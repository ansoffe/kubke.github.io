### Project Landing Pages

The menu to the right links to abstracts for most of my recent
reseach projects.  These pages also include automated feeds from
my workflow, indicating active issues or next steps, recent notebook
entries, current literature I'm reading on the topic, etc.

### My Toolbox

* **Analytic methods**: Dynamical systems, stochastic calculus, probability, master equation/linear noise approximation, optimal control
* **Numerical methods**: High-performance computing, numerical differential equations, approximate likelihood methods, machine learning, stochastic dynamic programming.
* **Data Science methods**: Automating data extraction and data-mining from large data repositories (XML, regexp, semantic/linked data). Software development practices, authoring R packages, data management.

I also enjoy exposure to fieldwork whenever I can convince colleagues to take me along. Though my own research has no field component, I'm thankful for recent opportunities from surveying pitfall traps for tiger salamanders to helping excavate icthysaur fossils in the Nevada desert. Have a field site that needs an extra pair of hands? I have over eight years of experience as an alpine guide and can carry a shovel.




### Perspectives and practices in Open Science

My somewhat uncommon approach to my own research ocassionally attracts attention of those outside my own field.  I have recently been interviewed by various journals asking to share my perspective and motivation.
