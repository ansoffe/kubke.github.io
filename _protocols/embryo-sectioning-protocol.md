# Embryo sectioning protocol

1. Carefully cut off the end of the tube, and push the gel containing the embryo out onto a petri dish. 

2. Place the gel into a solution of 30% sucrose in glass distilled water, for roughly 24 hours.

3. Remove gel from the sucrose solution and cut off any excess gel which does not contain the embryo.

4. Set up the microtome - place a blob of Oct compound onto the freezing block and place the gel into it, with the embryo in an appropriate position for cross-sectional cutting.

5. Freeze the tissue at -29°C, and cut the embryo using the sliding microtome, into 35um thick slices. Using a paintbrush, transfer these slices into wells containing phosphate buffered saline.

6. Using a paintbrush, transfer the slices into a dish containing deionized water and a drop of Triton X100. Mount the slices onto a glass slide, and label the slide appropriately so that each slice can be identified. Allow the slices to air dry for at least 24 hours.

7. Add 95% glycerol to the slides and coverslip. The slices can be visualised once the glycerol has cleared the slices for at least 1 hour.
