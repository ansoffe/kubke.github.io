# Photo-oxidation protocol

Sourced from [Photoconversion of diaminobenzidine with different fluorescent neuronal markers into a light and electron microscopic dense reaction product](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.auckland.ac.nz/doi/10.1002/jemt.1070240103/epdf), written with reference to the section 'Photoconversion of the Carbocyanide Dyes DiI and DiO: Application for Light Microscopy'.

1. Prepare reagents.  
   a) Refer to the reagent list.  
   b) Tris-HCl Buffer should be made the day before use or earlier and stored at 4°C or room temperature, since it takes a few hours to prepare. DAB solution must be prepared immediately before use.
   c) DAB solution must be kept in a fume hood unless in a sealed container.

2. To photo-oxidise a wholemount embryo, carry out this protocol on a stage 28 chick embryo with cranial nerve ganglia labelled with DiI. To photo-oxidise embryo slices, embed a stage 28 chick embryo as instructed in the ![tissue embedding protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hm-solution-tissue-embedding-protocol.md), and cut according to the ![sectioning protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/embryo-sectioning-protocol.md).

3. Equilibrate the tissue in Tris-HCl buffer for the following times

| Floating slices | Mounted slices | Wholemount |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| Rinse 3 times, for 15 mins each rinse | Rinse 3 times, for 15 mins each rinse | Rinse once for 17 hours |
| Use a 12 well tray - transfer slices into mesh in well using a glass hook | Use glass coplin jar |  |

4. Put a tube of Tris-HCl buffer on ice in preparation for making the DAB solution

5. Pre-incubate the tissue in 1.5-2 mg/ml DAB-100 mM Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 7.6) as specified below. This preincubation must be in the dark.

| Floating slices | Mounted slices | Wholemount |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| 15 mins, kept on ice | 15 mins, kept on ice | 4.5 days, in the fridge (4°C) |
| Use a 12 well tray covered in tin foil - transfer slices between the wells with the mesh | Cover a plastic box in tin foil. Place the slide into the box and pipette DAB solution onto the slide - keep contained using a nail polish wall |  |

6. Change the ice. Remove the tin foil from the box. Immerse the tissue in a fresh, ice-cold DAB-Tris-HCl solution, in the containers specified in step 5.

7. Take the box and slide to the microscope room. Place the tissue + DAB solution under a fluorescence microscope to enable the photo-oxidation reaction to happen in the tissue (x 10, x 16, x 25, or x 40 Neofluar fluorescence objectives (Zeiss or Nikon) using a Leica ET-CY3 filter; and a 120 W mercury lamp.

8. As the reaction proceeds, every 15 minutes take the box and slide back to fume hood. Replace the incubation solution with a freshly prepared DAB-Tris-HCl solution (on ice). Replace the ice keeping the DAB on the slides cold every time the DAB solution is changed.

9. The reaction is finished when all fluorescence fades and a brownish DAB reaction product forms (this should be roughly 1 hour for the slices).

10. Once the fluorescence has completely vanished, rinse the tissue twice with 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6), and then twice in 0.01M PBS, following the timing specified below.

| Floating slices | Mounted slices | Wholemount |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| 15 mins per rinse | 15 mins per rinse | 17 hours per rinse |
| Use a 12 well tray - transfer slices using mesh container | Use glass coplin jar |  |

11. Place the floating slices in 0.01M PBS, and remove mounted slices from the PBS, allowing them to dry.
