* 1 ml of 40% (wt/vol) acrylamide
* 0.25 ml of 2% (wt/vol) bisacrylamide
* 1 ml of [10x PBS](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io-1/blob/master/_posts/asof/asof-10x-pbs-recipe.md)
* 2.5 ml of [16% (wt/vol) PFA](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io-1/blob/master/_posts/asof/asof-16-pfa-recipe.md)
* 5.25 ml of distilled water
* 0.025 g of VA-044 thermal initiator

Note: wt/vol = weight/volume.
Note: keep all ingredients and the reagent on ice.

Storage: store at -20°C until needed (can be stored for several weeks).
