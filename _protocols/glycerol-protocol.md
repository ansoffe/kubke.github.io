# Glycerol Protocol

Dissect the hindbrain away from the rest of the embryo. Discard the rest of the embryo.

Put the hindbrain through a series of glycerol as detailed below, each of the below for roughly 30 minutes. Ensure the hindbrain is completely covered by the solution in each case.

- 25% glycerol in PF4%/PB 0.1M
- 50% glycerol in PF4%/PB 0.1M
- 75% glycerol in PF4%/PB 0.1M
- 90% glycerol in PF4%/PB 0.1M

Place the hindbrain in the middle of a long glass slide, and cover with a drop of 100% glycerol, carefully so as not to produce any air bubbles.

To match the thickness of the hindbrain, 3 glass half-coverslips should be glued onto the glass slide on either side of the hindbrain. A long glass coverslip can then be placed over all of this, carefully so as not to generate any air bubbles.
