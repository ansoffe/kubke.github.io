# 7.5% gelatin solution recipe

To make 10ml of 7.5% gelatin solution, over a heat combine:

* 0.75g of gelatin powder
* 10ml of 0.01M phosphate buffered saline (PBS)

Note: Alternatives to PBS are 0.1M phosphate buffer, or 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS solution.

Next, dissolve 3g of sucrose in ~70% of the above gelatin solution over a heat. Once the sucrose had dissolved, add gelatine solution to bring the mixture to 10ml.


Storage: store at room temperature until needed (a few days at most).
