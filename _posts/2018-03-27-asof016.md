# Embryo asof016

The aim of this work was to generate data to be used for my honours thesis.

Embryo "asof016". Stage 27+ (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 27/03/18, and ended on ????????????


27/03/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. Asof staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof016 staging features:

- the beginning of a bill is evident (~27)
- bulges "c", "e" and "f" of the pharyngeal arches have a similar shape to the stage 28 diagram in Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. There is a distinct gap between bulges "c" and "f", shaped like that shown in the aforementioned diagram.
- the outlines of three toes can be seen (27-28)
- the toe and digital plates are pointed (27-28)

Since the embryo had many features which seemed halfway between a stage 27 and a stage 28 embryo, overall asof016 was put as a 27+ stage (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Particularly the facial ganglia may have been incorrectly identified, as mfk did not check them. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye used was more concentrated than used for past embryos, like that used for the asof014 injection. There was some contamination around the left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion, confirmed using the fluorescence microscope, and shown in image asof016_001 at the end of this entry. The embryo was incubated for 2 days at 37°C in PBS.

Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI was mixed somewhat with another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


29/03/18

When inspected in the morning, the label in asof016 did not appear to have travelled any further than the trigeminal ganglion. Asof took photographs of asof016 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain.

## Images asof016

Picture "asof016_001" - taken straight after the injection was done on 27/03/18. Shows both trigeminal ganglia, and dye contamination particularly around the left trigeminal ganglion. ![Image asof016_001](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof016_001.png)

Picture "asof016_002" - taken on 27/03/18 after contaminated tissue was removed and control trigeminal ganglion (right side, embryo p.o.v.) was removed. ![Image asof016_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof016_002.png)

Picture "asof016_004" - taken on 29/03/18 after two days of incubation. The DiI label does not appear to have travelled further than the trigeminal ganglion. ![Image asof016_004](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof016_004.png)

Picture "asof016_005" - taken on 29/03/18, low magnification image showing contamination in many places on embryos body. ![Image asof016_005](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof016_005.png)


Asof then placed asof016 into ice cold ![HM solution (STIFF GEL)](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hm-solution-(stiff-gel)-recipe.md) and kept at 4°C for 11 days with gentle shaking.
