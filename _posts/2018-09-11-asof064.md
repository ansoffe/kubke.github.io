# Embryo asof064

The aim of this work was to generate an embryo with labelled Vth cranial nerve neurons for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof064". Stage 22 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 06/09/18, and ended on 07/09/18. Good labelling of hindbrain V sensory and motor neurons was achieved. The embryo was put through a series of glycerol, and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected quite carefully so as not to damage or remove the nerve fibres
- As much dye as possible without majorly damaging the ganglion was injected into each ganglion
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated
- Both ganglia were injected from their medial aspect
- The right Vth ganglion was injected twice
- Both injections into the right ganglion contained only pink dye
- The motor root could be seen labelled on the right V ganglion


06/09/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof064 staging features:
- wing and leg buds are caudally pointing, and shorter than they are wide (22) 
- dorsal curvature = slightly curved (see lab notebook for sketch)
- somites not quite extending to the extreme tip of the tail (21)

Overall, asof064 was put at a stage 22 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI by pressure injection with methanol. The left ganglion was removed as a control, and then the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof064 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


07/09/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the right V ganglion was removed and asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md). Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then asof064 was disposed of.



## Images asof064

Picture "asof064_001" - taken 06/09/18. Shows the overall shape of the embryo for context and shows the dorsal curvature. This image shows the shape of the pharyngeal arches and the length/shape of the wing bud of asof064, for staging purposes. ![Image asof064_001](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof064_001.png)

Picture "asof064_002" - taken 06/09/18. Shows the length/shape of the leg bud of asof064, for staging purposes. Also shown is the way the somites do not extend quite to the etreme tip of the tail (difficult to see). ![Image asof064_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof064_002.png)

Picture "asof064_003" - taken straight after the injection was done on 06/09/18. Shows labelled trigeminal ganglia and fluorescent contamination around them. ![Image asof064_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof064_003.png)

Picture "asof064_004" - taken 06/09/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. ![Image asof064_004](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof064_004.png)

Picture "asof064_005" - taken 06/09/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. This image is the same view as asof064_004, but with a higher exposure to show the DiI which it was not possible to remove from the left trigeminal neurons (looks as if it has already entered the hindbrain during the injection). ![Image asof064_005](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof064_005.png)

Picture "asof064_006" - taken 06/09/18. Shows the injection into the Vth ganglion using the UV filter. ![Image asof064_006](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof064_006.png)

Picture "asof064_007" - taken 07/09/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof064_007](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof064_007.png)

Picture "asof064_008" - taken 07/09/18. Low magnification view showing the rhombomeres of the hindbrain using the UV filter. ![Image asof064_008](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof064_008.png)

Picture "asof064_009" - taken 07/09/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof064_008, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is also used to show the rhombomeres of the hindbrain. Trigeminal motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and all V motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 2 and 3. ![Image asof064_009](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof064_009.png)

Picture "asof064_010" - taken 07/09/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof064_008, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is turned off so that only the DiI labelling can be seen. Trigeminal motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and all V motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 2 and 3. Quite a lot of labelling is present in the left V motor neurons (both motor and sensory). ![Image asof064_010](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof064_010.png)

Picture "asof064_017" - taken 07/09/18. High exposure image showing 6 cell bodies in the floor plate of the hindbrain (circled) at the level of rhombomeres 2 and 3, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is turned off. Two of the cell bodies are only faintly labelled. This image has been colour adjusted to allow better visibility of the cell bodies in the floor plate. ![Image asof064_017_01](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof064_017_01.png)

Picture "asof064_019" - "asof064_021 - taken 07/09/18. Shows the same view as asof064_018, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is turned off. The focus is adjusted between images to show various processes crossing the floor plate. asof064_019 focusses on a process on the right hand side of the image. asof064_020 focusses on processes in the centre and on the left hand side of the image. asof064_021 focusses on the distal ends of the processes, but these were difficult to visualise. asof064_020 in particular also shows the left trigeminal motor neuron labelling.
