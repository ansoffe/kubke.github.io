# Embryo asof046

The aim of this work was to generate a labelled embryo for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof046". Stage 23 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 31/07/18, and ended on 01/08/18. Good labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was achieved. This embryo was put through a series of glycerol and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected moderately carefully so as not to damage or remove the motor root of the trigeminal nerve (but less carefully than asof037 and asof038)
- A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion
- The ganglia were primarily injected from the medial aspect
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated


31/07/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof046 staging features:
- wing and leg buds were as long as wide (23)
- overall shape of the pharyngeal arches resembles a stage 23 or possibly slightly younger

Overall, asof046 was put at a stage 23 (unconfirmed).


Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Cleared the tissue around each trigeminal ganglion quite well, all around and on the medial side of the most ventral part of the ganglion. But, did not do much clearing close to the medial base of the ganglia, to avoid accidentally removing the motor root. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected into each trigeminal ganglion, using a technique where the needle was inserted into the ganglion and then retracted slightly before expelling dye, which meant less force was required to expel dye. Injections into the right Vg were done many times - asof found it difficult to achieve a good level of dye inside the ganglion. A motor root could be seen, labelled, on each ganglion. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof046 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


01/08/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the right V ganglion was removed and asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md).

Once imaging was completed, asof046 was disposed of.



## Images asof046

Picture "asof046_001" - taken straight after the injection was done on 31/07/18. Shows labelled trigeminal ganglia and fluorescent contamination around them. ![Image asof046_001](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof046_001.png)

Picture "asof046_002" - taken 31/07/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. ![Image asof046_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof046_002.png)

Picture "asof046_003" - taken 01/08/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof046_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof046_003.png)

Picture "asof046_004" - taken 01/08/18. Shows the rhombomeres of the hindbrain using the UV filter. ![Image asof046_004](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof046_004.png)

Picture "asof046_005" - taken 01/08/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof046_004, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is also used to show the rhombomeres of the hindbrain. Trigeminal motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and some flecks of contamination are present throughout the hindbrain. All V neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 2 and 3. ![Image asof046_005](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof046_005.png)

Picture "asof046_006" - taken 01/08/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof046_004, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is turned off so that only the DiI labelling can be seen. Trigeminal motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and some flecks of contamination are present throughout the hindbrain. ![Image asof046_006](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof046_006.png)

Picture "asof046_010" - taken 01/08/18. Shows the distal ends of processes which have crossed the midline (circled), one of which turns caudally, and one of which continues straight across the hindbrain at the same level in the rostro-caudal axis (for better view of this, see asof046_multifocus002). This image also shows the small amount of contamination present in the left trigeminal nerve neurons. ![Image asof046_010](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof046_010.png)

Picture "asof046_011" - taken 01/08/18. Shows the same view as asof046_010, with the focus adjusted to show the proximal portions of processes which have crossed the midline, described in asof046_010.

Picture "asof046_012" - taken 01/08/18. Shows a possible cell body in the alar plate (circled, purple). Additionally, shows a few rostrally projecting trigeminal sensory processes (circled, blue), which project further rostrally in rhombomere 1 than the majority of trigeminal sensory neurons. ![Image asof046_012_01](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof046_012_01.png)
