# Embryo asof047

The aim of this work was to generate a labelled embryo for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof047". Stage 23 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 02/07/18, and ended on 03/08/18. Good labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was achieved. This embryo was put through a series of glycerol and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected quite carefully so as not to damage or remove the motor root of the trigeminal nerve (less carefully than asof037 and asof038, but more carefully than asof045 and asof046)
- A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion
- The ganglia were primarily injected from the medial aspect
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated


02/08/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof047 staging features:
- the overall shape of the pharyngeal arches is very characteristic of a stage 23
- leg and wing buds are longer than they are wide (23+)

Overall, asof047 was put at a stage 23 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Cleared the tissue around each trigeminal ganglion quite well, all around and on the medial side of the most ventral part of the ganglion. But, did not do much clearing close to the medial base of the ganglia, to avoid accidentally removing the motor root. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected into each trigeminal ganglion, using a technique where the needle was inserted into the ganglion and then retracted slightly before expelling dye, which meant less force was required to expel dye. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof047 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


03/08/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the right V ganglion was removed and asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md).

Once imaging was completed, asof047 was disposed of.

Picture "asof047_003" - taken 02/08/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. Fluorescence intensity = 2nd notch. ![Image asof047_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof047_003.png)

Picture "asof047_004" - taken 02/08/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. Fluorescence intensity = 3rd notch. ![Image asof047_004](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof047_004.png)

Picture "asof047_005" - taken 03/08/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof047_005](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof047_005.png)

Picture "asof047_006" - taken 03/08/18. Shows the rhombomeres of the hindbrain using the UV filter. ![Image asof047_006](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof047_006.png)

Picture "asof047_007" - taken 03/08/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof047_006, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is also used to show the rhombomeres of the hindbrain. Trigeminal motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and only a small amount of contamination is present lateral to the trigeminal sensory neuron column (circled). All V motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 2 and 3. ![Image asof047_007_01](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof047_007_01.png)

The white light is turned off so that only the DiI labelling can be seen. Trigeminal motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and only a small amount of contamination is present lateral to the trigeminal sensory neuron column (circled in image asof047_007). ![Image asof047_008](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof047_008.png)
