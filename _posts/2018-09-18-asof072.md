# Embryo asof072

The aim of this work was to generate an embryo with labelled Vth cranial nerve neurons for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof072". Stage 24 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 17/09/18, and ended on 17/09/18. This embryo was damaged by asof and so could not be used for labelling.

17/09/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof072 staging features:
- the overall shape of the pharyngeal arches seemed to be indicative of stage 24
- the shape/length of the wing buds was characteristic of stage 24

Overall, asof072 was put at a stage 24 (unconfirmed). Note: this staging was very approximate, because before asof could accurately stage this embryo, she damaged it while securing the dish, so the pharyngeal arches were broken, and both wing buds and one leg bud were severed and lost from the embryo. Therefore it was not possible to accurately stage the embryo.

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. However, asof found that the roots of both trigeminal ganglia had been severed, and so were no longer connected to the hindbrain. Therefore asof072 could not be labelled, and was disposed of.

Also shows the damage to the pharyngeal arches, the places where the severed limbs should be, and the general damage to the whole embryo. ![Image asof072_001](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof072_001.png)
