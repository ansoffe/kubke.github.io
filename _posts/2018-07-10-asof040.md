# Embryo asof040

The aim of this work was to generate a labelled embryo for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof040". Stage 23 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 02/07/18, and ended on 05/07/18. Good labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was achieved. This embryo was put through a series of glycerol and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount. It was unclear whether there were any labelled cell bodies in the hindbrain alar plate. Asof attempted to cut the hindbrain in cross-section, but due to a short embedding time and a short solidifying time, it was not possible to mount the sections.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected carefully so as not to damage or remove the motor root of the trigeminal nerve
- A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion
- The ganglia were primarily injected from the medial aspect
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated
- The left Vg (embryo p.o.v.) was damaged (the most ventral part was accidentally removed), but the injection into this ganglion was better than the injection into the right Vg.
- Injection into this embryo had less purple crystals than asof039, only pink dye.


02/07/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof040 staging features:
- the somites extend to the tip of the tail (22)
- overall shape of the pharyngeal arches resembles a stage 23
- wing and leg buds are roughly as long as they are wide, and pointing caudally (23)

Overall, asof040 was put at a stage 23 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Cleared the tissue around each trigeminal ganglion quite well, all around and on the medial side of the most ventral part of the ganglion. But, did not do much clearing close to the medial base of the ganglia, to avoid accidentally removing the motor root. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected into each trigeminal ganglion, using a technique where the needle was inserted into the ganglion and then retracted slightly before expelling dye, which meant less force was required to expel dye. A motor root could be seen on both ganglia during the injection. Injections into the left Vg were done around three times from the medial aspect. The right (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof040 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


03/07/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the left V ganglion was removed and asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md).

Once cleared, multiple photographs were taken of the hindbrain with a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) using filter ET-CY3. Then, the hindbrain was removed from glycerol and placed into PBS overnight.


04/07/18

At midday, the hindbrain was placed into a 7.5% gelatine solution, prepared according to the ![gelatin recipe](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/gelatin-recipe.md). The gelatin mixture containing the embryo was left in the incubator at 37°C for four hours. Then the tube containing the asof040 hindbrain was placed into the fridge at 4°C to solidify. This was rotated by hand until the gelatin solidified with the hindbrain in the middle. This was left in the fridge for two hours, after which the gelatin containing asof040 was removed from the tube and placed into cold paraformaldehyde (4% PFA in PB 0.1M solution). This was left in the fridge at 4°C overnight. The gelatin did not seem as if it was as well solidified as in previous experiments.


05/07/18

The gelatin was rinsed in 0.01M PBS, and frozen at -29°C on the sliding microtome in a blob of Oct. Asof attempted to cut sections at 35um, but found that they disintegrated so that it would not be possible to mount them. Asof then attempted to cut sections at 50um, but when placed into PBS, each hindbrain section totally separated from the gelatin surrounding it. Since it is not feasible to mount hindbrain sections without the gelatin surrounding them, asof040 was disposed of.

Picture "asof040_003" - taken 02/07/18 after the contamination had been removed, focussed on the small amount of dye could not be removed from the right V nerve's proximal root. ![Image asof040_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof040_003.png)

Picture "asof040_004" - taken 03/07/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof040_004](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof040_004.png)

Sensory neuron processes are visible in the alar plate. A small amount of labelling is present in the neurons of the right V nerve. ![Image asof040_005](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof040_005.png)
