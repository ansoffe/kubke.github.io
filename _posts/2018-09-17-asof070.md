# Embryo asof070

The aim of this work was to generate an embryo with labelled Vth cranial nerve neurons for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof070". Stage 24+ (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 17/09/18, and ended on 18/09/18. Mostly good labelling of hindbrain V sensory and motor neurons was achieved. The embryo was put through a series of glycerol, and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected quite carefully so as not to damage or remove the nerve fibres
- As much dye as possible without majorly damaging the ganglion was injected into each ganglion
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated (more small crystals added 17/09/18)
- Both ganglia were injected from their medial aspect
- The right Vth ganglion was injected twice
- Both injections into the right ganglion contained only pink dye
- The motor root could be seen labelled on the right V ganglion


17/09/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof070 staging features:
- the overall shape of the pharyngeal arches is indicative of stage 24+ (protuberance c has a shape very characteristic of stage 25, but e has not become fully pointed and is not centred between f and c - it is much closer to f)
- leg and wing buds are the correct length and shape for stage 24 (their contour does not have two points, unlike stage 25)

Overall, asof070 was put at a stage 24+ (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI by pressure injection with methanol. The left ganglion was removed as a control, and then the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof070 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


18/09/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the right V ganglion was removed and asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md). Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then asof070 was disposed of.

Picture "asof070_007" - taken 17/09/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. Shows that some DiI was not able to be removed from the left trigeminal nerve fibres. ![Image asof070_007](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof070_007.png)

Picture "asof070_008" - taken 18/09/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. There appears to be a gap in motor neuron labelling in the basal plate. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof070_008](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof070_008.png)

Picture "asof070_010" - taken 18/09/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof070_009, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is also used to show the rhombomeres of the hindbrain. Trigeminal motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and all basal plate V motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 2 and 3. Some labelling in the basal plate is present at the level of the VII/VIII nerve. There is an apparent gap in motor neuron labelling in the basal plate of rhombomere 2. Many cell bodies are labelled in the alar plate around the level of rhombomeres 3 and 4. ![Image asof070_010](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof070_010.png)

The white light is turned off so that only the DiI labelling can be seen. Trigeminal motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and all basal plate V motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 2 and 3. Some labelling in the basal plate is present at the level of the VII/VIII nerve. There is an apparent gap in motor neuron labelling in the basal plate of rhombomere 2.

All basal plate V motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 2 and 3. Some labelling in the basal plate is present at the level of the VII/VIII nerve. There is an apparent gap in motor neuron labelling in the basal plate of rhombomere 2. Many cell bodies are labelled in the alar plate around the level of rhombomeres 3 and 4. ![Image asof070_013](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof070_013.png)

Picture "asof070_015" - "asof070_017" - taken 18/09/18. This series of images shows the pattern of motor neuron labelling in the basal plate, with the focus adjusted in each image. asof070_015 also shows labelled fibres switching bundles. This pattern of labelling can be seen more clearly in asof070_multifocus002. Note that a section of motor neurons are not labelled in the basal plate, while a new section of cell bodies and processes is labelled in the alar plate. This may be due to a difference in injection site.
