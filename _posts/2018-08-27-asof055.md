# Embryo asof055

The aim of this work was to generate an embryo with labelled VIIIth cranial nerve neurons for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof055". Stage 23 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 27/08/18, and ended on 28/08/18.

Specifics of injection:


27/08/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof055 staging features:
- wing and leg buds are as long as they are wide (23)
- overall appearance of pharyngeal arches is characteristic of stage 23 (the mandibular process and arch II are of a similar length, and the mandibular process is rounded, not pointed)

Overall, asof055 was put at a stage 23 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof peeled out the otic vesicle on each side to expose both vestibulocochlear (VIIIth) ganglia.
