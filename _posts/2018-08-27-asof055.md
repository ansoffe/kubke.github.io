# Embryo asof055

The aim of this work was to generate an embryo with labelled VIIIth cranial nerve neurons for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof055". Stage 23 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 27/08/18, and ended on 28/08/18. Good labelling of hindbrain VIII cranial nerve sensory and motor neurons was achieved. This embryo was put through a series of glycerol and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected quite carefully so as not to damage or remove the nerve fibres
- As much dye as possible without majorly damaging the ganglion was injected into each ganglion
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated
- The right ganglion was injected from the medial aspect, and the left ganglion was injected from the lateral aspect
- Each ganglion was injected 2-3 times


27/08/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof055 staging features:
- wing and leg buds are as long as they are wide (23)
- overall appearance of pharyngeal arches is characteristic of stage 23 (the mandibular process and arch II are of a similar length, and the mandibular process is rounded, not pointed)

Overall, asof055 was put at a stage 23 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof peeled out the otic vesicle on each side to expose both vestibulocochlear (VIIIth) ganglia. Asof injected both vestibulocochlear ganglia with concentrated red DiI by pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected into each vestibulocochlear ganglion, using a technique where the needle was inserted into the ganglion and then retracted slightly before expelling dye, which meant less force was required to expel dye. The left ganglion was removed as a control, and then the contamination was cleared. There was quite a lot of DiI contamination on the VIIth ganglia, and therefore both of these ganglia were removed. Asof took photographs of asof055 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS. 


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


28/08/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the right VIII ganglion was removed and asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md).

The hindbrain was photographed using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA). Once imaging was completed, asof055 was disposed of.



## Images asof055

Picture "asof055_001" - taken straight after the injection was done on 27/08/18. Shows labelled vestibulocochlear ganglia and fluorescent contamination around them. ![Image asof055_001](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof055_001.png)

Picture "asof055_002" - taken 27/08/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left vestibulocochlear ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. Both facial ganglia had also been removed. ![Image asof055_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof055_002.png)

Picture "asof055_003" - taken 28/08/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof055_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof055_003.png)

Picture "asof055_005" - taken 28/08/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof055_004, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is also used to show the rhombomeres of the hindbrain. Vestibulocochlear motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and all VIII motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 4 and 5. ![Image asof055_005](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof055_005.png)
