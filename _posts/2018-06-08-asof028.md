# Embryo asof028

The aim of this work was to generate data for my honours project. 

Embryo "asof028". Stage 23+ (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 22/05/18, and ended on 26/05/18. The labelling was successful in this embryo, with dye travelling throughout the ganglion, as well as into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. The embryo was embedded in HM solution (STIFF GEL). Once polymerised, asof attempted to cut this using the microtome without first embedding with sucrose, to see if the sucrose had an effect on the unspecific staining. However, the sectioning produced un-usable sections, because the gel did not freeze properly (like when cut on the vibratome) without having been embedded with a liquid that would freeze. The sections of asof028 were disposed of.

What I changed from previous embryos (labelling method): 
- this is a younger embryo (stage 24 as opposed to 28)
- I added dye crystals straight from the bottle rather than using the lid, so there were a lot more crystals in the well
- the dye was injected with the needle medial to the ganglion, quite low down near the hindbrain, so that the dye was on the medial side of the ganglion (coinciding with the path of the motor fibres)


22/05/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof028 staging features:
- pharyngeal arches overall shape is a 23 or 23+ - protuberance c of the mandibular process is possibly receeding
- wing and leg buds are longer than they are wide (24)
- the digital plate doesn't yet have a pointed contour (23+), but is not as rounded as a stage 23
- the toe plate has a pointed contour (24)

Overall, asof028 was put at a stage 23+ (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was quite concentrated, as asof had added crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI straight before the injection. A fairly high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion. There was a little contamination around each of the trigeminal ganglia. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof028 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated for 2 days at 40°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


24/05/18

When inspected in the afternoon, the DiI label in asof028 had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Motor neurons were well labelled. Asof took a picture of asof028, using the microscope and filter mentioned above. The embryo was then placed into ice cold ![HM solution (STIFF GEL)](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hm-solution-(stiff-gel)-recipe.md) and kept at 4°C for 12 days with gentle shaking.


05/06/18

In the evening, asof de-gassed the tube according to the ![Hydrogel tissue embedding protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hydrogel-tissue-embedding-protocol.md) and put asof021 into the incubator at 37°C.


07/06/18

The HM gel had polymerised when the tube was checked in the afternoon. This was tested by inverting the tube, and seeing that the gel did not move. The polymerised HM gel containing asof028 was removed from the eppendorf tube. Asof cut asof028 with the sledge microtome (which has a freezing attachment), without cryoprotecting in sucrose, as follows. The HM gel containing the embryo was placed onto a drop of OCT on the microtome block and frozen at -29°C. The microtome was used to cut cross-sectional slices, at the following thicknesses:
- Trays 1-2C (50um)
- Tray 2 Row D2, D4-6 (70um), D3 (35um)
- Tray 3 (70um)

Trigeminal ganglion fluorescence was present in Tray 2 Row B - Tray C Row A. These sections did not hold together at all and there was almost no HM solution gel surrounding the hindbrain or other tissue in the sections. A few hindbrain sections were mounted successfully, despite the lack of HM gel. These were placed into de-ionised water (containing a drop of Triton X100), then mounted onto glass slides. However, the only section which could be succesfully imaged was Tray 2 Row D3 (the only section cut at 35um). The fluorescence in the other sections was too widespread (presumably because the sections were too thick). Images were taken using the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) with filter ET-CY3.
