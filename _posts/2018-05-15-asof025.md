# Embryo asof025

The aim of this work was to generate a labelled embryo to use in testing the gelatin embedding technique.

Embryo "asof025". Stage 28 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 10/05/18, and ended on ????????????


10/05/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof025 staging features:

- distinct outgrowth of the beak is evident in profile (28)
- protuberance f has a shape characteristic of stage 28
- protuberance c is large and rounded (28-29)
- four toes are present (28)
- three (or possibly four) digits present (>26)

Overall, asof025 was put as a stage 28 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was quite concentrated, as asof had added more fresh crystals to the well. A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion. There was a little contamination around each of the trigeminal ganglia. The right (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof025 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated for 4 days at 40°C in PBS. 


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


15/05/18

In the morning, asof inspected asof025 and found that the DiI label had not travelled throughout the ganglion or into the hindbrain. Asof took a photograph of asof025 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3.

Picture "asof025_004" - taken 15/05/18 after four days of incubation. The DiI label has not travelled past the trigeminal ganglion. ![Image asof025_004](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof025_004.png)
