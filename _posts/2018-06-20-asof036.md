# Embryo asof036

The aim of this work was to generate a labelled embryo for use in determining whether cryoprotecting in sucrose had an effect on unspecific DiI labelling. 

Embryo "asof036". Stage 23 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 14/06/18, and ended on 18/06/18. Good labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was achieved. This embryo was used for comparison with asof027 and asof030 - all were embedded in gelatin but asof027 was cryoprotected with sucrose, and asof030 was not. Sections of this embryo were mainly cut at 35um, to compare with asof027, which was mainly cut at 50um. It seemed easier to identify individual labelled cells in 35um thick sections than in 50um sections.

Specifics of injection:
- This embryo was dissected very carefully so as not to damage or remove the motor root of the trigeminal nerve. The motor root of the left V ganglion could be seen during dissection
- A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion
- The ganglia were injected from the medial aspect
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated


14/06/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof036 staging features:
- overall shape of the pharyngeal arches appears to be between a stage 23 and a stage 24
- wing and leg buds are as long as they are wide (23)

Overall, asof036 was put at a stage 23 (unconfirmed).


Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected (2 hours injection time for 3 embryos) into each trigeminal ganglion. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof036 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated for 1 day at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


15/06/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. A photograph was taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) and then the embryo was then placed in paraformaldehyde (4% PFA in PB 0.1M solution) at room temperature on a rocker for 5 hours. The embryo was then transferred to a 30% sucrose solution (1.5g sucrose in 5ml paraformaldehyde (4% PFA in PB)). This was left at room temperature on a rocker overnight.


16/06/18

In the afternoon, asof036 was placed into a 7.5% gelatine solution (1.127g of gelatine in 15ml of 0.01M PBS, dissolved at ~40°C. 4.5g of sucrose was added to 70% of the gelatine solution, and dissolved at ~40°C. Once the sucrose had dissolved, gelatine solution was added to bring the mixture to 15ml). The gelatin mixture containing the embryo was left in the incubator at 37°C overnight.


17/06/18

In the morning, asof placed the tube containing the gelatin solution and asof036 into the fridge at 4°C, first rotating this by hand to ensure the embryo was in the middle of the gelatin when it solidified. When this began to solidify, the tube was left in the fridge on a rocker rolling from side to side to ensure the embryo did not sink to the bottom of the tube.

In the evening, asof removed the solidified gelatin containing asof036 from the tube, and placed this into cold paraformaldehyde (4% PFA in PB 0.1M solution). This was left in the fridge at 4°C overnight.


18/06/18

In the morning, asof removed the solidified gelatin containing asof036 from the paraformaldehyde, and placed this into 0.01M PBS to rinse off the PFA. This was then frozen at -29°C on the sliding microtome in a blob of Oct. Cross-sectional slices were cut at the following thicknesses:
- Tray 1 Row B - Tray 2 Row C1 (50um)
- Tray 2 Row C2 - Tray 3 Row A (35um)
- Tray 3 Row B1-2 (25um)
- Tray 3 Row B3 - Tray 4 Row D (35um)

Sections were placed into PBS in 24 well trays on ice, and then placed in the fridge. Trigeminal ganglion fluorescence was present from Tray 2 Row D - Tray 4 Row A.

Sections containing DiI fluorescence were placed into de-ionised water (containing a drop of Triton X100), then mounted onto glass slides, and allowed to air dry. These were imaged with a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) using filter ET-CY3.

Picture "asof036_tray3_D1_001" - taken on 18/06/18 straight after mounting and air drying. It looks as if fluorescence is even throughout the entire hindbrain, even on the control side. Fluorescence was more even when observed through the microscope by eye.
