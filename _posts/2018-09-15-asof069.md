# Embryo asof069

The aim of this work was to generate an embryo with labelled Vth cranial nerve neurons for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof069". Stage 24+ (late) (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 10/09/18, and ended on 11/09/18. Good labelling of hindbrain V sensory and motor neurons was achieved. The embryo was put through a series of glycerol, and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected quite carefully so as not to damage or remove the nerve fibres
- As much dye as possible without majorly damaging the ganglion was injected into each ganglion
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated
- Both ganglia were injected from their medial aspect (except for the fourth injection into the right ganglion, which was from the lateral aspect)
- The right Vth ganglion was injected four times
- The first three injections into the right ganglion contained only pink dye, the fourth contined a few purple crystals, and was only a tiny injection
- The motor root could be seen labelled on the right V ganglion (although it was no longer attached at the top of the ganglion - but still attached to the hindbrain)


10/09/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof069 staging features:
- the leg and wing buds are much longer than wide, and pointed rather than smooth oval contours (25)
- the overall shape of the pharyngeal arches is indicative of stage 24+ (closer to 25 than 24 - protuberance c has receded, and is beginning to be shaped like a stage 25 c. Protuberance e is beginning to be visible as a point between protuberances f and c)

Overall, asof069 was put at a stage 24+ (late) (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI by pressure injection with methanol. The left ganglion was removed as a control, and then the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof069 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


11/09/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the right V ganglion was removed and asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md). Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then asof069 was disposed of.

Picture "asof069_008" - taken 11/09/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof069_008](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof069_008.png)

Picture "asof069_009" - taken 11/09/18. Low magnification view showing the rhombomeres of the hindbrain using the UV filter. ![Image asof069_009](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof069_009.png)

Picture "asof069_010" - taken 11/09/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof069_009, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is also used to show the rhombomeres of the hindbrain. Trigeminal motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and all V motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 2 and 3. There appears to be a gap in the motor neuron labelling in rhombomere 2. ![Image asof069_010](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof069_010.png)

The white light is turned off so that only the DiI labelling can be seen. Trigeminal motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and all V motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 2 and 3. There appears to be a gap in the motor neuron labelling in rhombomere 2. ![Image asof069_011](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof069_011.png)

Picture "asof069_022" - taken 11/09/18. Shows one more labelled cell body in the alar plate (circled), caudal to the V nerve entry point. This image has been colour adjusted for better visibility of the alar plate cell body. ![Image asof069_022_01](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof069_022_01.png)

Pictures "asof069_023" - "asof069_025" - taken 11/09/18. These images document a labelled cell body in the alar plate which represents contamination. This cell body is much more brightly labelled than the other alar plate neurons, and its axon cannot be traced back to the afferent fibres - instead, it appears to terminate in a bulbous structure. asof069_023 shows its cell body, asof069_024 shows its axon, and asof069_025 shows the bulbous termination. Also, this cell body may be further lateral than any of the other alar plate neurons that have been observed previously.
