# Embryo asof045

The aim of this work was to generate a labelled embryo for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof045". Stage 23 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 31/07/18, and ended on 01/08/18. Labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was not achieved so asof045 was disposed of. When the injections in asof045_002 and asof046_002 were compared, it can be seen that there is a higher intensity of fluorescence in the asof046 injection. Therefore, the lack of success in asof045 may have been due to less concentrated dye being injected into asof045.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected moderately carefully so as not to damage or remove the motor root of the trigeminal nerve (but less carefully than asof037 and asof038)
- A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion
- The ganglia were primarily injected from the medial aspect
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye should have been highly concentrated


31/07/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof045 staging features:
- overall shape of the pharyngeal arches resembles a stage 23
- wing and leg buds were as long as wide, and their shape is characteristic of stage 23

Overall, asof045 was put at a stage 23 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Cleared the tissue around each trigeminal ganglion quite well, all around and on the medial side of the most ventral part of the ganglion. But, did not do much clearing close to the medial base of the ganglia, to avoid accidentally removing the motor root. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected into each trigeminal ganglion, using a technique where the needle was inserted into the ganglion and then retracted slightly before expelling dye, which meant less force was required to expel dye. Injections into the right Vg were done three times from the medial aspect. A motor root could be seen, labelled, on the right (embryo p.o.v.) ganglion. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof045 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


01/08/18

When inspected in the morning, the DiI label in asof045 had not travelled any further than the trigeminal ganglion. Asof took a photograph of asof045 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3.

Since the DiI label had not travelled further than the ganglion, asof045 was disposed of.

Picture "asof045_002" - taken 31/07/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. ![Image asof045_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof045_002.png)

Picture "asof045_003" - taken 01/08/18 after overnight incubation. The DiI label has not travelled into the hindbrain from the trigeminal ganglion. ![Image asof045_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof045_003.png)
