# Embryo asof034

The aim of this work was to generate a labelled embryo for use in determining whether cryoprotecting in sucrose had an effect on unspecific DiI labelling. 

Embryo "asof034". Stage 23 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 14/06/18, and ended on 15/06/18. Labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was not achieved so asof034 was disposed of.


Specifics of injection:
- This embryo was dissected very carefully so as not to damage or remove the motor root of the trigeminal nerve
- A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion
- The ganglia were injected from the medial aspect
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated


14/06/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof034 staging features:
- overall shape of the pharyngeal arches resembles a stage 23
- wing and leg buds are roughly as long as they are wide (23)

Overall, asof034 was put at a stage 23 (unconfirmed).


Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected (2 hours injection time for 3 embryos) into each trigeminal ganglion. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof034 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated for 1 day at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


15/06/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had not travelled from the ganglion into the neurons of the hindbrain. Asof034 was left in the incubator for the rest of the day in case the dye travelled into the neurons during this time. At the end of the day, since the dye still had not travelled into the hindbrain neurons, asof034 was disposed of.

Picture "asof034_002" - taken on 14/06/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. ![Image asof034_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof034_002.png)

Picture "asof034_003" - taken on 15/06/18 after asof034 had been incubated overnight. Shows that DiI labelling has not travelled into the hindbrain. ![Image asof034_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof034_003.png)
