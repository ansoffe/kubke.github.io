# Embryo asof073

The aim of this work was to generate an embryo with labelled Vth cranial nerve neurons for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof073". Stage 22 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 17/09/18, and ended on 18/09/18. Good labelling of hindbrain V sensory and motor neurons was achieved. The embryo was put through a series of glycerol, and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected quite carefully so as not to damage or remove the nerve fibres
- As much dye as possible without majorly damaging the ganglion was injected into each ganglion
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated (more small crystals added 17/09/18)
- Both ganglia were injected from their medial aspect
- The right Vth ganglion was injected twice
- Both injections into the right ganglion contained pink dye, and the first also contained purple crystals
- The motor root could be seen labelled on the right V ganglion


17/09/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof073 staging features:
- the leg and wing buds were both wider than they were long, and both pointing caudally (22)
- the somites extend right to the tip of the tail (22)

Overall, asof073 was put at a stage 22 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI by pressure injection with methanol. The left ganglion was removed as a control, and then the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof073 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


18/09/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the right V ganglion was removed and asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md). Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then asof073 was disposed of.

Picture "asof073_006" - taken 17/09/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. Shows that some DiI was not able to be removed from the left trigeminal nerve fibres. ![Image asof073_006](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof073_006.png)

Picture "asof073_007" - taken 18/09/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof073_007](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof073_007.png)

Picture "asof073_009" - taken 18/09/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof073_008, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling.

Picture "asof073_011" - taken 18/09/18. See description in asof073_008. This is a higher magnification view of that image, at the level of rhombomeres 2 and 3, which also shows the floor plate of the hindbrain. ![Image asof073_011](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof073_011.png)

Picture "asof073_015" - taken 18/09/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof073_014, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is also used to show the rhombomeres and floor plate of the hindbrain.

Picture "asof073_multifocus002"  - taken 18/09/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof073_014, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is turned off so that only the DiI labelling can be seen. This image is a z-stack of images, showing many labelled processes which have crossed the floor plate, and more which are projecting towards it on the right side of the hindbrain. Some of the processes which have crossed the floor plate have turned caudally, and some have projected straight across. NOTE: some of the caudally projecting processes have turned much more laterally on the contralateral side than normal (normally they would turn straight after they exited the floor plate). NOTE ALSO: one labelled process has crossed from the left side of the hindbrain to the right side and turned and projected caudally.

Picture "asof073_023" - taken 18/09/18. Shows labelled trigeminal afferent processes going around the VII/VIII nerve entry point. Also shows faint processes labelled in the basal plate at the level of the VII/VIII nerve.  ![Image asof073_023](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof073_023.png)

Picture "asof073_024" - "asof073_025" - taken 18/09/18. These two images show a labelled process projecting caudally through rhombomeres 4 and 5, which may represent either contamination or biological variation. asof073_024 also shows a more faintly labelled process (lateral to the first process, medial to the trigeminal afferent column) also projecting caudally.

Picture "asof073_027" - taken 18/09/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof073_026, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is also used to show rhombomeres 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the hindbrain. Shows the caudal termination of the afferent trigeminal fibres, which appear to terminate around the caudal end of rhombomere 7 (though it is difficult to determine since they become very faintly labelled and diffuse at this point). Also shows a few flecks of contamination in the hindbrain. ![Image asof073_027](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof073_027.png)
