# Photo-oxidation 004

The aim of this work was to see if the results of the photo-oxidation method could be improved by oxygenation of the DAB solution, and by increasing the concentration of the DAB solution to 4% DAB. The photo-oxidation results seemed to be improved over previous results. However, photo-oxidation only occurred in the ganglion, where DiI crystals were located.

One floating 35um section of ![asof021](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-04-18-asof021.md) were used in this experiment. These slices contained DiI label in the left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion. This experiment began and was completed on 08/05/18.

Asof made 4mg/ml DAB solution (219mg DAB in 50ml 0.1M Tris-HCl Buffer), and placed this on ice, wrapped in tin foil.

Asof placed the asof021 section into 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7) for three washes, lasting 25 minutes, 15 minutes, and 20 minutes respectively. The section was transferred to 4mg/ml DAB solution and allowed to preincubate, on ice, in the dark, for 20 minutes.

The section was then transferred into fresh DAB solution and placed under the non-dissecting fluorescence microscope using the red filter (filter #3). The DAB solution was replaced every 20-25 minutes for 2 hours. The section was then left in DAB for 1.5 hours, and then the DAB solution was replaced, and the section left in it for 30 minutes. The DAB solution was oxygenated using carbogen prior to each replacement.

The photo-oxidation results seemed to be improved over previous results. However, photo-oxidation only occurred in the ganglion, where DiI crystals were located.

The floating section was removed from the DAB solution and washed three times in 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7), for 15 minutes per wash. The slice was stored at room temperature in 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7).
