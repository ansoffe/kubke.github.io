# Embryo asof050

The aim of this work was to generate a labelled embryo for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof050". Stage 23 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 06/07/18, and ended on 07/08/18. Good labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was achieved. This embryo was put through a series of glycerol and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected quite carefully so as not to damage or remove the motor root of the trigeminal nerve
- A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion
- The ganglia were primarily injected from the medial aspect
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated


06/08/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof050 staging features:
- the overall shape of the pharyngeal arches is characteristic of a stage 23
- the leg and wing buds are roughly as long as they are wide, and their shape is characteristic of a stage 23

Overall, asof050 was put at a stage 23 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Cleared the tissue around each trigeminal ganglion quite well, all around and on the medial side of the most ventral part of the ganglion. But, did not do much clearing close to the medial base of the ganglia, to avoid accidentally removing the motor root. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected into each trigeminal ganglion, using a technique where the needle was inserted into the ganglion and then retracted slightly before expelling dye, which meant less force was required to expel dye. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof050 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


07/08/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the right V ganglion was removed and asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md).

The hindbrain was inspected using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), however, asof was not able to photograph some parts of it until the following morning (08/08/18), at which point the hindbrain had been in 100% glycerol for 19 hours. Once imaging was completed, asof050 was disposed of.



## Images asof050

Picture "asof050_001" - taken straight after the injection was done on 06/08/18. Shows labelled trigeminal ganglia and fluorescent contamination around them. ![Image asof050_001](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof050_001.png)

Picture "asof050_002" - taken 06/08/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. ![Image asof050_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof050_002.png)

Picture "asof050_003" - taken 07/08/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof050_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof050_003.png)

Picture "asof050_004" - taken 07/08/18. Shows the rhombomeres of the hindbrain using the UV filter. ![Image asof050_004](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof050_004.png)

Picture "asof050_005" - taken 07/08/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof050_004, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is also used to show the rhombomeres of the hindbrain. Trigeminal motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and most V motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 2 and 3. ![Image asof050_005](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof050_005.png)

Picture "asof050_006" - taken 07/08/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof050_004, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is turned off so that only the DiI labelling can be seen. Trigeminal motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and most V motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 2 and 3. ![Image asof050_006](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof050_006.png)

Picture "asof050_007" - taken 07/08/18. See description in asof050_004. This is a higher magnification view of that image, at the level of rhombomeres 2 and 3, which also shows the floor plate of the hindbrain. ![Image asof050_007](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof050_007.png)

Picture "asof050_008" - taken 07/08/18. See description in asof050_005. This is a higher magnification view of that image, and the same view as asof050_007. Some labelled cell bodies appear to be located either in or above the floor plate of the hindbrain. ![Image asof050_008](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof050_008.png)

Picture "asof050_009" - taken 07/08/18. See description in asof050_006. This is a higher magnification view of that image, and the same view as asof050_007. With reference to asof050_008, some labelled cell bodies appear to be located either in or above the floor plate of the hindbrain (circled). ![Image asof050_009_01](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof050_009_01.png)

Picture "asof050_010" - taken 07/08/18. Image taken at the level of rhombomere 5, showing a labelled cell body.  This is at the level of VIIth/VIIIth cranial nerve neurons, so may be a result of DiI contamination of those nerves. Alternatively, this may represent biological variability. ![Image asof050_010](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof050_010.png)

Pictures "asof050_011" and "asof050_012" - taken 07/08/18. Show flecks of DiI contamination in the hindbrain at the level of rhombomere 5. These images show the same view but with the focus adjusted to show different flecks of contamination.

Picture "asof050_014" - taken 07/08/18. Shows the lack of DiI labelling in the left trigeminal neurons. ![Image asof050_014](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof050_014.png)

Picture "asof050_015" - "asof050_016" - taken 07/08/18. These images show labelled sensory processes projecting rostrally, beyond the point at which the major trigeminal sensory tracts terinate. However, there was no time on 07/08/18 to complete the series, so see the below series taken on 08/08/18.
