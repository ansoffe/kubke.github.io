# Hydrogel monomer solution recipe

## Hydrogel monomer (HM) solution

To make 10ml of Hydrogel Monomer solution, combine:

* 1 ml of 40% (wt/vol) acrylamide
* 0.25 ml of 2% (wt/vol) bisacrylamide
* 1 ml of 10× PBS
* 2.5 ml of 16% (wt/vol) PFA
* 5.25 ml of distilled water
* 0.025 g of VA-044 thermal initiator

Note: wt/vol = weight/volume.
Note: keep all ingredients and the reagent on ice.

Storage: store at -20°C until needed.

## 10x PBS

To make a 500ml stock of 10x PBS:
* 720mg KH2PO4
* 45000mg NaCl
* 3975mg Na2HPO4-7H2O
* Add these to 400ml distilled water
* Adjust pH to 7.4 with 1 N NaOH
* Make up the volume to 500ml with distilled water

Store this solution at room temperature. Dilute 1:10 with distilled water before use and adjust pH if necessary.

Storage: at room temperature for up to 2 years.


## 1x PBS

To make 200ml of 1x PBS solution:
* 20ml of 10x PBS
* 180ml of deionised water
* Check pH. If necessary, adjust to 7.3 + 0.1 at room temperature

Storage: at room temperature for up to 2 years.


## 16% PFA

To make 10ml of 16% PFA:
* Add 1.6g PFA to 8ml distilled water
* Heat to 60°C
* Add 1-2 drops of 1 n NaOH, as PFA requires the solution to have a basic pH before it will dissolve.
* Add distilled water to make the solution up to 10ml
