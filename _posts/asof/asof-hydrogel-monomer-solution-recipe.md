# Hydrogel monomer solution recipe

## Hydrogel monomer (HM) solution

To make 10ml of Hydrogel Monomer solution, combine:

* 1 ml of 40% (wt/vol) acrylamide
* 0.25 ml of 2% (wt/vol) bisacrylamide
* 1 ml of [10× PBS] (https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io-1/blob/master/_posts/asof/asof-10x-pbs-recipe.md)
* 2.5 ml of 16% (wt/vol) PFA
* 5.25 ml of distilled water
* 0.025 g of VA-044 thermal initiator

Note: wt/vol = weight/volume.
Note: keep all ingredients and the reagent on ice.

Storage: store at -20°C until needed.

## 1x PBS

To make 200ml of 1x PBS solution:
* 20ml of 10x PBS
* 180ml of deionised water
* Check pH. If necessary, adjust to 7.3 + 0.1 at room temperature

Storage: at room temperature for up to 2 years.

## 16% PFA

To make 10ml of 16% PFA:
* Add 1.6g PFA to 8ml distilled water
* Heat to 60°C
* Add 1-2 drops of 1 n NaOH, as PFA requires the solution to have a basic pH before it will dissolve.
* Add distilled water to make the solution up to 10ml

Storage: at 4°C [[[[[[[[[[[for up to one month]]]]]]]]]]]]
