1. Prepare the HM solution.  
   a) Refer to the [reagent list](URL_to_wiki).  
   b) Keep the HM solution and all ingredients used to prepare it, on ice - during preparation, storage and when in use.  
   c) Preparation is not time consuming, so these reagents can be prepared on the day before use - or can be prepared earlier than this and stored at -20°C (HM solution), room temperature (PBS), or 4°C (PFA) as they are stable.  
   d) Before starting the tissue embedding, make sure that there is no precipitation floating in the HM solution.  

2. Dissect a chick embryo and label the cranial nerve ganglia with DiI.

3. Incubate the labelled embryo overnight at 37°C in 3ml 1x PBS to allow the DiI to travel the length of the neurons.

4. Take the chick embryo (with DiI labelled) and incubate in 1ml ice-cold 1× PBS for 4 days.

NOTE: Carry out steps 5 - 9 in a fume hood, as the HM solution is toxic.

5. Place the embryo in 1ml of HM solution in a 1ml tube. Incubate the embryo at 4°C for 4 days.

6. To remove oxygen from the sample, place the 1ml tube on a rack in a desiccation chamber. Partially open the cap of the tube to allow gas exchange.

7. Open the nitrogen tank main valve and adjust the control valve to fill the desiccation chamber with nitrogen gas. Next, toggle the desiccation chamber valve from the nitrogen gas in-flow to the vacuum pump outlet.

8. Turn on the vacuum pump. Verify that the chamber is under full vacuum by testing the chamber lid. Keep it running for 10 minutes.

9. Switch the vacuum pump off; the nitrogen will slowly fill the chamber. Carefully open the chamber just enough to reach the tubes, and then tighten the lids while continuously purging with nitrogen gas. This is to remove all the oxygen (because oxygen inhibits hydrogel polymerization, so we want to remove as much oxygen as possible).

10. Put the air-tight closed conical tube into the incubator at 37 °C until it has polymerised.
 
11. Once polymerisation has occurred, carefully extract the brain (or other tissues) from solidified hydrogel by softly rubbing all the hydrogel from the surface (wearing gloves).
