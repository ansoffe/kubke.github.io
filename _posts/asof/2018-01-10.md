# Embryo asof007

The aim of this work was to attempt to cut a whole, undissected embryo embedding in the HM solution polymer.

Embryo "asof007". Work with this embryo began on 04/01/18, and was completed on 10/01/18. This embryo was used to test whether an embryo could be cut within the polymerised HM solution with a vibrotome, but this was unsuccessful.

04/01/18

This embryo was placed whole into "STIFF GEL" HM solution at 4 degrees C, after this solutionhad been thawed from storage at -18 degrees C. It had not been labelled, or pre-incubated in ice cold PBS, contrary to the instructions in the "HM tissue embedding protocol", since this was just a test to see whether the embryo and gel could be cut by the vibratome. Embryo "asof007" was left in HM solution at 4 degrees C for 4 days, on a rocker to provide gentle shaking.

08/01/18

Asof de-gased the tube according to the instructions in the "HM tissue embedding protocol". The tube was placed in the incubator overnight at 37 degrees C.

09/01/18

In the morning, the HM solution in the tube had polymerised. This was tested by turning the tube upside down and observing that the solution did not move. The tube was left in the incubator out of convenience.

10/01/18

Mfk attempted to cut the gel and embryo with the vibratome, but this was unsuccessful, as the vibratome blade did not cut the gel but rather pushed it away (the gel was not stiff enough). Embryo asof007 was discarded.
