# Embryo asof031

The aim of this work was to determine whether cryoprotecting in sucrose had an effect on unspecific DiI labelling. 

Embryo "asof031". Stage 24 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 11/06/18, and ended on 13/06/18. Labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was not achieved so asof031 was disposed of.


11/06/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof031 staging features:
- pharyngeal arches overall shape resembles a stage 23-24 - protuberance c of the mandibular process is receeding
- wing and leg buds are longer than they are wide (24)

Overall, asof031 was put at a stage 24 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI straight before the injection. Dye was injected until the trigeminal ganglia were too perforated to allow further injections (although this happened after fewer injections than in past embryos). The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof031 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated for 2 days at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


12/06/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had not travelled from the ganglion into the neurons of the hindbrain. Asof031 was left in the incubator for another 24 hours in case the dye travelled into the neurons during this time.


13/06/18

The dye still had not travelled into the hindbrain neurons. Asof031 was disposed of.
