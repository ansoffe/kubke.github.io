# Embryo asof032

The aim of this work was to generate a labelled embryo for use in determining whether cryoprotecting in sucrose had an effect on unspecific DiI labelling. 

Embryo "asof032". Stage 23 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 12/06/18, and ended on 14/06/18. Labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was not achieved so asof032 was disposed of.


12/06/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof032 staging features:
- overall shape of the pharyngeal arches resembles a stage 24
- wing and leg buds are roughly as long as they are wide (23)
- flexure: dorsal contour from hindbrain to tail is a curved line (23)

Overall, asof032 was put at a stage 23 (unconfirmed).


Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. Dye was injected until the trigeminal ganglia were too perforated to allow further injections (although this happened after fewer injections than in past embryos). The right (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof032 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated for 2 days at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


13/06/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had not travelled from the ganglion into the neurons of the hindbrain. Asof032 was left in the incubator for another 24 hours in case the dye travelled into the neurons during this time.


14/06/18

The dye still had not travelled into the hindbrain neurons. Asof032 was disposed of.
