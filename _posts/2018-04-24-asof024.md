# Embryo asof024

The aim of this work was to generate data for my honours project.

Embryo "asof024". Stage 28 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 24/04/18, and ended on ????????????


24/04/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof024 staging features:

- bill is evident (28-29)
- 3 toes visible (26?)
- one toe is longer than the others, giving the toe plate a pointed contour (28?)
- the overall shape of the toe plate is characteristic of stage 28
- 2 digits visible (26?)
- the overall shape of the digital plate is characteristic of stage 28

Overall, asof024 was put as a stage 28 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye used was quite concentrated, however, the amount of crystals in the well was far less than what was used for asof020 and asof021, et cetera. A high volume was injected into each ganglion. There was a little contamination around each of the trigeminal ganglia, and there was particularly bad contamination injected into/under the hindbrain on the left side (embryo p.o.v.) as can be seen in asof024_002. The right (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and most of the contamination was cleared. However, it was not possible to clear the aforementioned contamination in/under the hindbrain as it was inaccessible. Asof took photographs of asof024 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated for 2 days at 40°C in PBS. 


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


26/04/18

When inspected in the afternoon, the DiI label in asof024 did not appear to have travelled any further than the trigeminal ganglion. Asof took a photograph of asof024 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3.

Since the DiI label had not travelled further than the ganglion, asof024 was disposed of.


## Images asof024

Picture "asof024_001" - taken straight after the injection was done on 24/04/18. Shows both trigeminal ganglia, and dye contamination around them.

Picture "asof024_002" - taken on 24/04/18. This is a longer exposure picture of asof024_001, to show the contamination in/under the hindbrain.

Picture "asof024_003" - taken on 24/04/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the right trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. ![Image asof024_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof024_003.png)

Picture "asof024_004" - taken on 26/04/18 after two days of incubation. The DiI label has not travelled past the trigeminal ganglion. This image also shows the aforementioned contamination within/underneath the hindbrain, inferior to the left (embryo p.o.v.) ganglion.
