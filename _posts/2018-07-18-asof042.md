# Embryo asof042

The aim of this work was to practice the DiI injection technique.

Embryo "asof042". Stage 23 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 17/07/18, and ended on 18/07/18. DiI labelling was unsuccessful in this embryo (did not travel from the ganglion into the hindbrain neurons). Note: this embryo was an eye mutant (very undersized right eye and almost complete absence of left eye). The pharyngeal arches appeared to be normally formed, but once dissected, it appeared that the left trigeminal ganglion had developed abnormally, being more cranially located than was usual, and elogated in the cranial-caudal axis. This abnormal development may also have affected the right trigeminal ganglion, and have been responsible for the unsuccessful labelling.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected with moderate care so as not to damage or remove the motor root of the trigeminal nerve
- A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion
- The ganglia were primarily injected from the medial aspect
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated


17/07/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof042 staging features:
- overall shape of the pharyngeal arches resembles a stage 23 or younger
- wing and leg buds are roughly as long as they are wide (23), and their shape is characteristic of stage 23-24

Overall, asof042 was put at a stage 23 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Cleared the tissue around each trigeminal ganglion quite well, all around and on the medial side of the most ventral part of the ganglion. But, did not do much clearing close to the medial base of the ganglia, to avoid accidentally removing the motor root. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected into each trigeminal ganglion, although slightly less than injected into asof041. The injection was carried out using a technique where the needle was inserted into the ganglion and then retracted slightly before expelling dye, which meant less force was required to expel dye. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof042 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37.5°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


18/07/18

When inspected in the morning, the DiI label in asof042 had not travelled any further than the trigeminal ganglion. Asof took a photograph of asof042 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3.

Since the DiI label had not travelled further than the ganglion, asof042 was disposed of.
