# Embryo asof20

The aim of this work was to try to get the DiI labelling method to work.

Embryo "asof020". Stage 26+ (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 17/04/18, and ended on ????????????


17/04/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac from the embryo. Asof staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof020 staging features:

- the pharyngeal arches were staged overall at a 27, because the shape of protuberance f was the same as in the sketches in Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. Protuberances f and c were closely associated, and the point of e was visible above f, which supported the staging at stage 27.
- the shape of the digital and toe plates was similar to stage 26
- the bill was not evident (26)

Overall, asof020 was put as a stage 26+ (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye used was highly concentrated due to mfk having put more DiI crystals in the well, and a high volume was injected into each ganglion. There was a little contamination around each of the trigeminal ganglia. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, since the injection was better in the right ganglion. Asof took photographs of asof020 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated for 2 days at 40°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


19/04/18

When inspected in the afternoon, the DiI label in asof020 appeared to have travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Asof took a picture of asof020, using the microscope and filter mentioned above. The embryo was then placed into ice cold ![HM solution (STIFF GEL)](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hm-solution-(stiff-gel)-recipe.md) and kept at 4°C for 10 days with gentle shaking.



## Images asof020

Picture "asof020_001" - taken straight after the injection was done on 17/04/18. Shows both trigeminal ganglia, and dye contamination around them.

Picture "asof020_002" - taken on 17/04/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. ![Image asof020_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof020_002.png)

Picture "asof020_003" - taken on 19/04/18 after two days of incubation. Shows the right (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion and DiI labelling of sensory and motor trigeminal neurons. Sensory neurons are running up and down on the periphery of the hindbrain and motor neurons are projecting into the centre of the hindbrain from the point of entry to the hindbrain of the trigeminal nerve.
