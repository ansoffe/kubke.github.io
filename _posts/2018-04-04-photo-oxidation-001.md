# Photo-oxidation 001

The aim of this work was to test the photo-oxidation method. Floating slices of ![asof011](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-01-22-asof011.md) were used in this experiment. These slices contained DiI label in the trigeminal and auditory ganglia. This experiment began and was completed on 29/03/18.

29/01/18

Mfk made 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer (made from 100ml of 1M Tris and 900ml of glass double distilled water).

Asof checked the floating slices of asof011 for the presence of fluorescence before the start of the experiment, using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA). There was some fluorescence in each slice. Asof equilibrated one 35um slice of asof011 in 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer at room temperature, for 15 minutes twice, and then for 35 minutes once. This was done using a mesh container which was transferred between wells of Tris-HCl buffer.

Mfk made 2mg/ml DAB solution (30mg DAB in 15ml Tris-HCl buffer), and placed this on ice, wrapped in tin foil.

Asof put 2ml of ice cold 2mg/ml DAB solution in a well and transferred the mesh container to this well. This was left to preincubate in the dark for 15 minutes. However, when the mesh container was transferred to a second well of ice-cold DAB solution and observed under the fluorescence microscope, it was discovered that the slice of asof011 was no longer in the mesh container. Due to lack of time, a second slice of asof011 was placed into ice cold 2mg/ml DAB solution without equilibrating in 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer, or preincubating in 2mg/ml DAB solution in the dark. This was placed under the fluorescence microscope, illuminated with filter ET-CY3 (red filter), while still on ice. After 15 minutes, the slice was transferred into a fresh, ice-cold 2mg/ml DAB solution. After a further 20 minutes, the slice was transferred into a fresh, ice-cold 2mg/ml DAB solution. Since no brown DAB substrate could be observed after the two periods in DAB solution, it was decided to leave the asof011 slice in the DAB solution under the fluorescent microscope for 50 minutes, not on ice, to see if the reaction was going to happen.

## Photo-oxidation 001 images:

First 15 minutes under fluorescence microscope: 
Ten minutes after the second slice of asof011 was placed in DAB, picture photoox001_001 was taken. ![photoox001_001](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/photoox001_001.png)

After a further 20 minutes under fluorescence microscope:
Picture photoox001_002 was taken. ![photoox001_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/photoox001_002.png)

After another 50 minutes under fluorescence microscope:
Picture photoox001_003 was taken. ![photoox001_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/photoox001_003.png)

No DAB substrate product was observed in the asof011 slice, and no reduction in DiI fluorescence was observed. The slice of asof011 was disposed of.
