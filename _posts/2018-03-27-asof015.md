# Embryo asof015

The aim of this work was to generate data to be used for my honours thesis.

Embryo "asof015". Stage 28 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 23/03/18, and ended on 26/03/18. Asof injected the embryo, but the dye did not travel, and asof accidentally removed the ganglion after incubation, so the embryo was disposed of.


23/03/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac from the embryo. Asof then staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof015 staging features:

- collar f is the same shape as stage 28 embryo drawing in Hamburger and Hamilton staging criteria
- beak is evident (27-28)
- maxillary process shape similar to stage 28 embryo in in Hamburger and Hamilton staging criteria
- toe and digital plates have a pointed contour (~28)

Overall, the embryo was put at an early stage 28 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye used was more concentrated than used for past embryos, like that used for the asof014 injection. There was a lot of contamination around each of the ganglia injected, confirmed using the fluorescence microscope, and shown in image asof015_001 at the end of this entry. The embryo was incubated for 2.5 days over the weekend at 37°C in PBS, but when checked on Monday morning, it was observed that the PBS had evaporated and the embryo had dried up.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI was mixed somewhat with another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


26/03/18

Early in the morning, asof discovered that asof015 had dried out in the incubator, and added PBS to the dissection dish containing asof015. 

Later in the day, asof took photographs of asof015 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain.

## Images asof015:

Asof then realised that cutting off the trigeminal ganglion was a mistake, and since the dye had not travelled into the hindbrain, there was no dye in the embryo. This was possibly due to not injecting enough dye, not injecting concentrated enough dye, or due to the embryo drying up during the incubation. Asof and mfk decided it was not worth embedding the embryo, and asof015 was disposed of.
