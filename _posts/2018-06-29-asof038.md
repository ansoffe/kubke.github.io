# Embryo asof038

The aim of this work was to generate a labelled embryo for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof038". Stage 22 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 25/06/18, and ended on 26/06/18. Good labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was achieved. This embryo was put through a series of glycerol and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount.

Specifics of injection:
- NEW: During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected very carefully so as not to damage or remove the motor root of the trigeminal nerve
- A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion
- The ganglia were primarily injected from the medial aspect
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated


25/06/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof038 staging features:
- wing and leg buds are as long as they are wide (23 or younger), but their base is a wide attachment (22 or 22+)
- maxillary process is very pointy and triangular (22)
- the overall size of the embryo is smaller than stage 23 embryos I have previously dissected
- dorsal curvature is very curved (22)

Overall, asof038 was put at a stage 22 (unconfirmed).


Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Cleared the tissue around each trigeminal ganglion more than with asof037, all around and on the medial side of the most ventral part of the ganglion. But, did not do much clearing close to the medial base of the ganglia, to avoid accidentally removing the motor root. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected into each trigeminal ganglion, using a new technique where the needle was inserted into the ganglion and then retracted slightly before expelling dye, which meant less force was required to expel dye. Injections into the right Vg were done twice from the medial aspect, once from the caudal aspect and once from the lateral aspect. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and cut in half to check that DiI had been injected into the middle of the ganglion (it had). The contamination was also cleared, but a small amount of fluorescence could not be removed from the left V proximal nerve root. Asof took photographs of asof038 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


26/06/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then removed the right V ganglion and cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md).

Once cleared, multiple photographs were taken of the hindbrain with a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) using filter ET-CY3. However, a lot of flecks of fluorescence contamination were present in many places, with cell bodies randomly and sporadically labelled throughout the hindbrain. Therefore asof038 was disposed of.

A small amount of dye could not be removed from the left V nerve's proximal root. ![Image asof038_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof038_003.png)

It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof038_004](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof038_004.png)
