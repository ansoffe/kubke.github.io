# Embryo asof066

The aim of this work was to generate an embryo with labelled Vth cranial nerve neurons for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof066". Stage 22 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 06/09/18, and ended on 07/09/18. Good labelling of hindbrain V sensory and motor neurons was achieved. The embryo was put through a series of glycerol, and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected quite carefully so as not to damage or remove the nerve fibres
- As much dye as possible without majorly damaging the ganglion was injected into each ganglion
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated
- Both ganglia were injected from their medial aspect
- The right Vth ganglion was injected three times
- All injections into the right ganglion contained only pink dye
- The motor root could be seen labelled on the right V ganglion


06/09/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof066 staging features:
- eye pigmentation is distinct (22)
- wing and leg buds are shorter than they are wide, and pointing caudally. The wing bud seems like a stage 22, while the leg bud seems like a 22+.
- somites extend to tip of tail (22)

Overall, asof066 was put at a stage 22 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI by pressure injection with methanol. The left ganglion was removed as a control, and then the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof066 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


07/09/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the right V ganglion was removed and asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md). Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then asof066 was disposed of.

Picture "asof066_006" - taken 07/09/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof066_006](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof066_006.png)

Picture "asof066_008" - taken 07/09/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof066_007, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is also used to show the rhombomeres of the hindbrain. Trigeminal motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and all V motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 2 and 3. ![Image asof066_008](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof066_008.png)

Picture "asof066_009" - taken 07/09/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof066_007, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is turned off so that only the DiI labelling can be seen. Trigeminal motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and all V motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 2 and 3. A few flecks of contamination are present throughout the hindbrain, but there is an absence of contralateral labelling. Some contamination is present at the level of the VII/VIIIth nerves. ![Image asof066_009](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof066_009.png)
