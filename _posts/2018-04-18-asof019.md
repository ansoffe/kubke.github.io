# Embryo asof019

The aim of this work was to try to get the DiI labelling method to work.

Embryo "asof019". Stage 29 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 12/04/18, and ended on 19/04/18. The DiI label did not travel past the trigeminal ganglion and so asof019 was disposed of. The labelling method was thought not to have worked because the embryo was dissected a few days prior to injection, and perhaps also because not enough volume of dye was injected.


12/04/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. Asof staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof019 staging features:

- bill protrudes out, and is a similar shape to stage 29
- arm bud is bent at elbow (29)
- four toes are visible (28-29)
- three digits are visible (28-29)

Overall, asof019 was put as a stage 29 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. The embryo was then placed into 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and stored at 4°C until it could be injected.


17/04/18

The embryo was not in such good condition after being left for five days. However, asof still injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye used was highly concentrated due to mfk having put more DiI crystals in the well, however, not as high volume was injected as for ![asof020](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-04-18-asof020.md) and ![asof021](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-04-18-asof021.md) (which were injected on the same day). There was a little contamination around each of the trigeminal ganglia. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, since the injection was better in the right ganglion. Asof took photographs of asof019 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. Asof019 was then incubated for 2 days at 40°C in PBS.

Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


19/04/18

When inspected in the afternoon, the DiI label in asof019 did not appear to have travelled any further than the trigeminal ganglion. Asof took photographs of asof019 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3.

Since the DiI label had not travelled further than the ganglion, asof019 was disposed of.

Picture "asof019_002" - taken on 17/04/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. ![Image asof019_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof019_002.png)

Picture "asof019_003" - taken on 19/04/18 after two days incubation. The DiI label has not travelled past the trigeminal ganglion.
