# Embryo asof058

The aim of this work was to generate an embryo with labelled VIIIth cranial nerve neurons for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof058". Stage 23+ (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 30/08/18, and ended on 31/08/18. Labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was not achieved so asof058 was disposed of.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected quite carefully so as not to damage or remove the nerve fibres
- As much dye as possible without majorly damaging the ganglion was injected into each ganglion
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated
- The right ganglion was injected from the medial aspect, and the left ganglion was injected from the lateral aspect
- The right VIIIth ganglion was injected twice
- Both injections into the right ganglion contained only pink dye


30/08/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof058 staging features:
- overall appearance of pharyngeal arches is characteristic of stage 23 (the mandibular process and arch II are of a similar length, and the mandibular process is rounded, not pointed). However, may be close to 23+ because arch II is quite pointy.
- wing and leg buds are longer than they are wide (24)

Overall, asof058 was put at a stage 23+ (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof peeled out the otic vesicle on each side to expose both vestibulocochlear (VIIIth) ganglia. Asof injected both vestibulocochlear ganglia with concentrated red DiI by pressure injection with methanol. The left ganglion was removed as a control, and then the contamination was cleared. There was quite a lot of DiI contamination on the VIIth ganglia, and therefore both of these ganglia were removed. Asof took photographs of asof058 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


31/08/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had not travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then asof058 was disposed of.

Picture "asof058_003" - taken 30/08/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left vestibulocochlear ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. Both facial ganglia had also been removed. ![Image asof058_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof058_003.png)
