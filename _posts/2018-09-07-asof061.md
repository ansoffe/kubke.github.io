# Embryo asof061

The aim of this work was to generate an embryo with labelled VIIIth cranial nerve neurons for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof061". Stage 23 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 03/09/18, and ended on 04/09/18. Adequate labelling of hindbrain VIII sensory and motor neurons was achieved, however it seemed like less labelling than would ordinarily occur. This embryo was put through a series of glycerol and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected quite carefully so as not to damage or remove the nerve fibres
- As much dye as possible without majorly damaging the ganglion was injected into each ganglion
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated
- The right ganglion was injected from the medial and dorsal aspect, and the left ganglion was injected from the lateral aspect
- The right VIIIth ganglion was injected twice
- Both injections into the right ganglion contained only pink dye


03/09/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof061 staging features:
- overall appearance of pharyngeal arches is characteristic of stage 23 (the mandibular process and arch II are roughly the same length - however, the mandibular process looks a little bit pointy, maybe heading towards 23+)
- wing and leg buds are as long as they are wide (23) and the correct shape for stage 23

Overall, asof061 was put at a stage 23 (unconfirmed).


Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof peeled out the otic vesicle on each side to expose both vestibulocochlear (VIIIth) ganglia. Asof injected both vestibulocochlear ganglia with concentrated red DiI by pressure injection with methanol. The left ganglion was removed as a control, and then the contamination was cleared. There was quite a lot of DiI contamination on the VIIth ganglia, and therefore both of these ganglia were removed. Asof took photographs of asof061 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


04/09/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. However, there did not look to be as much labelling as usual (but mfk said this may just be natural variation). Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the right VIII ganglion was removed and asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md).

The hindbrain was photographed using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA). The hindbrain had some flecks of contamination present (not serious?), and also a bit of contralateral V motor and sensory neuron labelling. Once imaging was completed, asof061 was disposed of.

Picture "asof061_003" - taken straight after the injection was done on 03/09/18. Shows labelled vestibulocochlear ganglia and fluorescent contamination around them. ![Image asof061_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof061_003.png)

Picture "asof061_004" - taken 03/09/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left vestibulocochlear ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. Both facial ganglia had also been removed. ![Image asof061_004](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof061_004.png)

Picture "asof061_005" - taken 03/09/18. Shows the injection into the VIIIth ganglion using the UV filter. ![Image asof061_005](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof061_005.png)

Picture "asof061_006" - taken 04/09/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. The labelling does not appear to be as dense as usual. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof061_006](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof061_006.png)

Picture "asof061_007" - taken 04/09/18. Low magnification view showing the rhombomeres of the hindbrain using the UV filter. ![Image asof061_007](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof061_007.png)

Picture "asof061_008" - taken 04/09/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof061_007, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is also used to show the rhombomeres of the hindbrain. Vestibulocochlear motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and all VIII motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 4 and 5. One process can be seen projecting into rhombomere 6, but this does not appear to be a motor neuron. ![Image asof061_008](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof061_008.png)

Picture "asof061_009" - taken 04/09/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof061_007, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is turned off so that only the DiI labelling can be seen. Vestibulocochlear motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and most VIII motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 4 and 5. One process can be seen projecting into rhombomere 6, but this does not appear to be a motor neuron. ![Image asof061_009](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof061_009.png)
