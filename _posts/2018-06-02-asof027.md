# Embryo asof027

The aim of this work was to generate a labelled embryo to use in testing the gelatin embedding technique.

Embryo "asof027". Stage 24 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 22/05/18, and ended on 26/05/18. The dye travelled throughout the ganglion, as well as into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Good labelling was achieved in this embryo. 

What I changed from previous embryos: 
- this is a younger embryo (stage 24 as opposed to 28)
- I added dye crystals straight from the bottle rather than using the lid, so there were a lot more crystals in the well
- the dye was injected with the needle medial to the ganglion, quite low down near the hindbrain, so that the dye was on the medial side of the ganglion (coinciding with the path of the motor fibres)


22/05/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof027 staging features:

- the overall shape of the pharyngeal arches (association and shape of c and f - see drawing in hard copy lab notebook) is characteristic of stage 24
- digital plate countour is more pointed than rounded (24)
- toe plate countour is more pointed than rounded (24)
- leg not very long (<25)
- wings and legs longer than they are wide (24)

Overall, asof027 was put at a stage 24 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was quite concentrated, as asof had added crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI straight before the injection. A fairly high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion. There was a little contamination around each of the trigeminal ganglia. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof027 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated for 1 day at 40°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


23/05/18

When inspected in the afternoon, the DiI label in asof027 had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Motor neurons were well labelled. Asof027 was placed into a 30% sucrose solution (1.5g sucrose in 5ml paraformaldehyde (4% PF in PB)). This was left at room temperature on a rocker for around 5 hours, and the embryo sank to the bottom of the tube.

After 5 hours, asof027 was placed into a 7.5% gelatine solution (7.5g of gelatine in 100ml of 0.01M PBS, dissolved at ~30°C. 30g of sucrose was added to 70ml of the gelatine solution, and dissolved at ~35°C. Once the sucrose had dissolved, gelatine solution was added to bring the mixture to 100ml). The gelatin mixture containing the embryo was left in the incubator at 37°C overnight.


24/05/18

The tube was filled up to the lid with gelatin solution. This was left for 1 day to solidify at 4°C, on a rocker to keep the tube rolling, so that the embryo would end up in the middle of the solidified solution.


25/05/18

Asof removed the solidified gelatin from the tube, and froze this at -29°C on the sliding microtome in a blob of Oct. The sections were cut at 50um, as they did not hold together and were very curly when cut at 35um. Sections were placed into 24 well trays containing PBS on ice, and then placed in the fridge. Trigeminal ganglion fluorescence was present in tray 3, row A - C.

Some sections were placed into de-ionised water (containing a drop of Triton X100), then mounted onto glass slides, and allowed to air dry. These were imaged with a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) using filter ET-CY3.


26/05/18 

In the morning, the remaining sections were placed into de-ionised water (containing a drop of Triton X100), then mounted onto glass slides, and allowed to air dry. These were imaged with a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) using filter ET-CY3.
