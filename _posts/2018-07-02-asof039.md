# Embryo asof039

The aim of this work was to generate a labelled embryo for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof039". Stage 23 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 02/07/18, and ended on 03/07/18. Good labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was achieved. This embryo was put through a series of glycerol and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount. However, due to DiI contamination of the hindbrain, this embryo could not be used for data collection.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected carefully so as not to damage or remove the motor root of the trigeminal nerve
- A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion
- The ganglia were primarily injected from the medial aspect
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated


02/07/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof039 staging features:
- overall shape of the pharyngeal arches resembles a stage 23 
- wing and leg buds are as long as they are wide (23 or younger)

Overall, asof039 was put at a stage 23 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Cleared the tissue around each trigeminal ganglion quite well, all around and on the medial side of the most ventral part of the ganglion. But, did not do much clearing close to the medial base of the ganglia, to avoid accidentally removing the motor root. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected into each trigeminal ganglion, using a technique where the needle was inserted into the ganglion and then retracted slightly before expelling dye, which meant less force was required to expel dye. Injections into the right Vg were done around three times from the medial aspect. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control (and the motor root could be seen on it, labelled, once the ganglion was detached), and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof039 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


03/07/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the right V ganglion was removed and cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md).

Once cleared, multiple photographs were taken of the hindbrain with a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) using filter ET-CY3. However, a lot of flecks of fluorescence contamination were present in many places, with cell bodies randomly and sporadically labelled throughout the hindbrain. Therefore asof039 was disposed of.



## Images asof039

Picture "asof039_001" - taken straight after the injection was done on 02/07/18. Shows labelled trigeminal ganglia and fluorescence around them. ![Image asof039_001](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof039_001.png)

Picture "asof039_002" - taken 02/07/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. A small amount of dye could not be removed from the left V nerve's proximal root. ![Image asof039_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof039_002.png)

Picture "asof039_003" - taken 03/07/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof039_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof039_003.png)

Picture "asof039_004" - taken 03/07/18. Low magnification view of DiI labelling in the right Vth nerve. Motor neuron processes and cell bodies are visible in the basal plate. Sensory neuron processes are visible in the alar plate. Some contamination is present throughout the hindbrain, including a bright patch on the left side of the hindbrain (embryo p.o.v.). ![Image asof039_004](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof039_004.png)

Picture "asof039_005" - taken 03/07/18. Shows lots of labelled cell bodies in the alar plate lateral to the trigeminal sensory neuron processes. The slight fluorescence in the top left-hand corner of the image (viewer p.o.v.) is on the glass, due to movement of the coverslip. ![Image asof039_005](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof039_005.png)

Picture "asof039_006" - taken 03/07/18. Shows lots of labelled cell bodies in the alar plate lateral to the trigeminal nerve's point of entry to the hindbrain. ![Image asof039_006](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof039_006.png)

Picture "asof039_007" - taken 03/07/18. Shows right trigeminal nerve motor neuron cell bodies and processes. ![Image asof039_007](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof039_007.png)

Picture "asof039_008" - taken 03/07/18. Shows neuronal projections which have crossed the midline (probably from the right V nerve (embryo p.o.v.), but difficult to tell). ![Image asof039_008](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof039_008.png)

Picture "asof039_009" - taken 03/07/18. Shows a small amount of DiI label present in the left trigeminal neuorns.
