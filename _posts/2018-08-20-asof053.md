# Embryo asof053

The aim of this work was to generate an embryo with labelled VIIIth cranial nerve neurons for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof053". Stage 23+ (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 20/08/18, and ended on 21/08/18.  Labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was not achieved so asof052 was disposed of. Labelling may not have been achieved because not a high enough volume of dye was injected into the ganglion (since its small size meant it was easily damaged). Could try using a smaller needle next time. 

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected quite carefully so as not to damage or remove the nerve fibres
- As much dye as possible without majorly damaging the ganglion was injected into each ganglion (however, this did not end up being a very high volume, because the ganglia were easily damaged)
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated
- The ganglia were injected from both the medial and the lateral aspect
- Each ganglion was only injected around 1.5 times, since it already seemed that they were falling apart after so few injections. 

20/08/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof053 staging features:
- wing and leg buds are slightly longer than wide (23+)
- overall appearance pf pharyngeal arches is characteristic of stage 23+ (protuberance f is quite large and bulbous, and the mandibular process has receded a little, although it is not pointy yet)

Overall, asof053 was put at a stage 23+ (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof peeled out the otic vesicle on each side to expose both vestibulocochlear (VIIIth) ganglia. Asof injected both vestibulocochlear ganglia with concentrated red DiI by pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected into each vestibulocochlear ganglion, using a technique where the needle was inserted into the ganglion and then retracted slightly before expelling dye, which meant less force was required to expel dye. However, the injection caused the right VIIIth ganglion to fall to pieces, and so it was removed as a control, and then the contamination was cleared. There was quite a lot of DiI contamination on the VIIth ganglia, and therefore both of these ganglia were removed. Asof took photographs of asof053 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


21/08/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had not travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then asof053 was disposed of.

Picture "asof053_002" - taken 20/08/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the right vestibulocochlear ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. Both facial ganglia had also been removed. ![Image asof053_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof053_002.png)

Picture "asof053_003" - taken 21/08/18 after overnight incubation. The DiI label has not travelled into the hindbrain from the vestibulocochlear ganglion. ![Image asof053_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof053_003.png)
