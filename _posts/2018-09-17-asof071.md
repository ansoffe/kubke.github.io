# Embryo asof071

The aim of this work was to generate an embryo with labelled Vth cranial nerve neurons for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof071". Stage 24 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 17/09/18, and ended on 18/09/18. Good labelling of hindbrain V sensory and motor neurons was achieved. The embryo was put through a series of glycerol, and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected quite carefully so as not to damage or remove the nerve fibres
- As much dye as possible without majorly damaging the ganglion was injected into each ganglion
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated (more small crystals added 17/09/18)
- Both ganglia were injected from their medial aspect
- The right Vth ganglion was injected three times
- First two injections into the right ganglion contained only pink dye, while the third contained some purple crystals
- The motor root could be seen labelled on the right V ganglion


17/09/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof071 staging features:
- the overall shape of the pharyngeal arches is indicative of stage 23+ to 24 (protuberance c is pointed, but has not receded)
- the shape and length of the leg and wing buds is characteristic of stage 24

Overall, asof071 was put at a stage 24 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI by pressure injection with methanol. The left ganglion was removed as a control, and then the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof071 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


18/09/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the right V ganglion was removed and asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md). Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then asof071 was disposed of.

Picture "asof071_005" - taken straight after the injection was done on 17/09/18. Shows labelled trigeminal ganglia and fluorescent contamination around them. ![Image asof071_005](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof071_005.png)

Picture "asof071_006" - taken 17/09/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. Shows that a small amount of DiI was not able to be removed from the left V motor fibres, as it already seemed to be inside the hindbrain. ![Image asof071_006](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof071_006.png)

Picture "asof071_007" - taken 18/09/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof071_007](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof071_007.png)

Picture "asof071_009" - taken 18/09/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof071_008, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling.

Picture "asof071_017" - "asof071_023" - taken 18/09/18.
