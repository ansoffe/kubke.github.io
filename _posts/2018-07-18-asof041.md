# Embryo asof041

The aim of this work was to generate a labelled embryo for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof041". Stage 23 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 17/07/18, and ended on ??????/07/18. Good labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was achieved. This embryo was put through a series of glycerol and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount. 

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected moderately carefully so as not to damage or remove the motor root of the trigeminal nerve (but less carefully than asof037 and asof038)
- A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion
- The ganglia were primarily injected from the medial aspect
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated
- Injection into this embryo had purple crystals


17/07/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof041 staging features:
- wing and leg buds are roughly as long as they are wide (23)
- the pharyngeal arches apppear to belong to an embryo stage 23 or younger, due to the small, rounded shape of the maxillary protuberance

Overall, asof041 was put at a stage 23 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Cleared the tissue around each trigeminal ganglion quite well, all around and on the medial side of the most ventral part of the ganglion. But, did not do much clearing close to the medial base of the ganglia, to avoid accidentally removing the motor root. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected into each trigeminal ganglion, using a technique where the needle was inserted into the ganglion and then retracted slightly before expelling dye, which meant less force was required to expel dye. A motor root could be seen on both ganglia during the injection. Injections into the right Vg were done around four times from the medial aspect, and once from the lateral aspect. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof041 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37.5°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


18/07/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the right V ganglion was removed and asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md).



## Images asof041

Picture "asof041_001" - taken straight after the injection was done on 17/07/18. Shows labelled trigeminal ganglia and fluorescent contamination around them. ![Image asof041_001](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof041_001.png)

Picture "asof041_002" - taken 17/07/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. ![Image asof041_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof041_002.png)

Picture "asof041_003" - taken 18/07/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof041_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof041_003.png)
