# Embryo asof037

The aim of this work was to generate a labelled embryo for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof037". Stage 23+ (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 25/06/18, and ended on 28/06/18. Good labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was achieved. This embryo was put through a series of glycerol and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount. Then the embryo was cut in cross section to observe the labelled neurons.

Specifics of injection:
- NEW: During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected very carefully so as not to damage or remove the motor root of the trigeminal nerve
- A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion
- The ganglia were primarily injected from the medial aspect
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated


25/06/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof037 staging features:
- overall shape of the pharyngeal arches resembles a stage 23 
- wing and leg buds are marginally longer than they are wide (23+)
- the shape of the digital and toe plates is characteristic of a stage 23+ (they are beginning to be a little pointed on the side rather than completely rounded)

Overall, asof037 was put at a stage 23+ (unconfirmed).


Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Cleared the tissue around each trigeminal ganglion quite well, all around and on the medial side of the most ventral part of the ganglion. But, did not do much clearing close to the medial base of the ganglia, to avoid accidentally removing the motor root. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected into each trigeminal ganglion, using a new technique where the needle was inserted into the ganglion and then retracted slightly before expelling dye, which meant less force was required to expel dye. Injections into the right Vg were done three times from the medial aspect and one time from the lateral aspect. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control (and the motor root could be seen on it, labelled, once the ganglion was detached), and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof037 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


26/06/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then removed the right V ganglion and cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. As the right V ganglion was removed, the motor root could be seen. The ganglion was also cut in half and a lot of fluorescence could be seen inside the ganglion. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md).

Once cleared, multiple photographs were taken of the hindbrain with a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) using filter ET-CY3. Then, the hindbrain was removed from glycerol and placed into PBS overnight.


27/06/18

Midmorning, the hindbrain was placed into a 7.5% gelatine solution (0.75g of gelatine in 10ml of 0.01M PBS, dissolved at ~40°C. 3g of sucrose was added to 70% of the gelatine solution, and dissolved at ~40°C. Once the sucrose had dissolved, gelatine solution was added to bring the mixture to 10ml). The gelatin mixture containing the embryo was left in the incubator at 37°C for the day.

In the evening, the tube containing the asof037 hindbrain was placed into the fridge at 4°C to solidify. This was rotated by hand until the gelatin solidified with the hindbrain in the middle.


28/06/18

In the morning, the gelatin containing asof037 was removed from the tube and placed into cold paraformaldehyde (4% PFA in PB 0.1M solution). This was left in the fridge at 4°C for two hours. The gelatin was then rinsed in 0.01M PBS, and frozen at -29°C on the sliding microtome in a blob of Oct. Cross-sectional slices were cut at the following thicknesses:
- Tray 1 Rows B-D1 (50um)
- Trays 2 - 4 (35um)

Sections were placed into PBS in 24 well trays on ice, and then placed in the fridge. Trigeminal ganglion fluorescence was present from roughly Tray 2 Row C - Tray 3 Row A. 

Sections containing DiI fluorescence were placed into de-ionised water (containing a drop of Triton X100), then mounted onto glass slides, and allowed to air dry. These were imaged with a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) using filter ET-CY3.
