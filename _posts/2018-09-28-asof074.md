# Embryo asof074

The aim of this work was to generate an embryo with labelled Vth cranial nerve neurons for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof074". Stage 24+ (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 17/09/18, and ended on 18/09/18. Good labelling of hindbrain V sensory and motor neurons was achieved. The embryo was put through a series of glycerol, and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected quite carefully so as not to damage or remove the nerve fibres
- As much dye as possible without majorly damaging the ganglion was injected into each ganglion
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated (more small crystals added 17/09/18)
- Both ganglia were injected from their medial aspect (and one lateral injection was done into the right Vg)
- The right Vth ganglion was injected three times (two medially and one laterally)
- One medial injection into the right ganglion contained purple crystals, and the other two contained pink dye
- The motor root could be seen labelled on the right V ganglion


17/09/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof074 staging features:
- the leg and wing buds are the right length and shape for stage 24 (leg bud possibly heading for stage 24+? beginning to develop a second point on the toe plate)
- the overall shape of the pharyngeal arches is indicative of stage 24+ (protuberance e is beginning to develop but is not yet pointed or midway between probuberances f and c. Also, protuberance c is fairly flat)

Overall, asof074 was put at a stage 24+ (unconfirmed). 

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI by pressure injection with methanol. The left ganglion was removed as a control, and then the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof074 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


18/09/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the right V ganglion was removed and asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md). Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then asof074 was disposed of.

Also visible is a short, thick labelled process projecting medially from the afferent trigeminal column in rhombomere 4. Also, this image shows the proximal ends of four labelled processes which project through rhombomeres 4 and 5. ![Image asof074_020](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof074_020.png)

Picture "asof074_021" - taken 18/09/18. The same view as asof074_020.

Picture "asof074_022" - taken 18/09/18. The same view as asof074_020. Shows the distal ends of three labelled processes which project through rhombomeres 4 and 5. One labelled cell body is present at the end of one of the processes, in rhombomere 5. Another cell body is labelled very close to it, and this is adjacent to contamination which can be seen better in asof074_023 and asof074_025 (so probably represents contamination). ![Image asof074_022](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof074_022.png)

The white light is also used to show rhombomeres 5, 6 and 7 of the hindbrain.
