# Embryo asof018

The aim of this work was to try to get the DiI labelling method to work.

Embryo "asof018". Stage 27 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 09/04/18, and ended on ????????????


09/04/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. Asof staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof018 staging features:

- overall appearance of protuberances b, c, e and f are characteristic of stage 27 (see drawing in physical lab notebook). c and f are too closely associated to be a stage 28.
- small protrusion of bill (27)
- 3 or 4 toes are visibe (2 obviously evident, 1-2 beginning/undefined)
- 2 digits visible
- beginnings of pointed contour of digital plate (27)

Overall, asof017 was put as a stage 27 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye used was much more concentrated than that used in past injections (except asof017, see note*), as Mfk had put more DiI crystals into the well (there had been no crystals in the well in past injections) (note*: asof017 and asof018 were injected on the same day). There was serious contamination underneath the left trigeminal ganglia (embryo p.o.v.), confirmed using the fluorescence microscope, and shown in image asof018_001 and asof018_002 at the end of this entry. Note: a control ganglion was not removed, because the contamination under the left ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) was too serious and would have affected any data. Instead, both ganglia were left in the hopes that the label would travel in at least one of them. The embryo was incubated for 2 days at 40°C in PBS (a higher temperature was used to see if this would help the DiI to travel better). Note: the PBS surrounding the embryo dried up twice over the course of the two day incubation before being replaced.

Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


11/04/18

When inspected in the morning, the label in asof017 did not appear to have travelled any further than the trigeminal ganglion. Asof took photographs of asof016 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3 unless specified otherwise.


## Images asof018

Picture "asof018_001" - taken straight after the injection was done on 09/04/18. Shows both trigeminal ganglia, and dye contamination, particularly underneath left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.). ![Image asof018_001](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof018_001.png)

Picture "asof018_002" - taken on 09/04/18. Shows a close up of the contamination under the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.), it is fuzzy and boomerang shaped.![Image asof018_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof018_002.png)

Picture "asof018_003" - taken on 09/04/18 after the contamination that could be removed had been removed, and the right trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. Note: a lot of contamination remained, as it was not possible to remove. ![Image asof018_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof018_003.png)

Picture "asof018_004" - taken on 11/04/18 after two days incubation. Shows that the label has not travelled further than the trigeminal ganglia. ![Image asof018_004](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof018_004.png)

Picture "asof018_005" - taken on 11/04/18. Close-up view of asof018_004, showing that fluorescence is present throughout the trigeminal ganglia. ![Image asof018_005](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof018_005.png)

Picture "asof018_006" - taken on 11/04/18. Same view as asof018_005, using UV filter to show that there is not much dye in the right (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion. There appears to be more dye in the left ganglion, but this is probably contamination underneath the ganglion.


The embryo was then covered with 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer to equilibrate.
