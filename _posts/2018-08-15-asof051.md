# Embryo asof051

The aim of this work was to generate an embryo with labelled VIIIth cranial nerve neurons for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof051". Stage 24 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 08/07/18, and ended on 09/08/18. Good labelling of hindbrain VIII cranial nerve sensory and motor neurons was achieved. This embryo was put through a series of glycerol and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected quite carefully so as not to damage or remove the nerve fibres
- A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion
- The ganglia were primarily injected from the medial aspect (although this may not have much of an effect in the VIIIth nerve as compared to the Vth nerve)
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated


08/08/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof051 staging features:
- the overall shape of the pharyngeal arches is characteristic of a stage 23+ or stage 24 - protuberance c is receding but has not yet fully receded
- the leg and wing buds are much longer than they are wide (24)

Overall, asof051 was put at a stage 24 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof peeled out the otic vesicle on each side to expose both vestibulocochlear (VIIIth) ganglia. Asof injected both vestibulocochlear ganglia with concentrated red DiI by pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected into each vestibulocochlear ganglion, using a technique where the needle was inserted into the ganglion and then retracted slightly before expelling dye, which meant less force was required to expel dye. The left (embryo p.o.v.) vestibulocochlear ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. There was quite a lot of DiI contamination on the VIIth ganglia, and therefore both of these ganglia were removed. Asof took photographs of asof051 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


09/08/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the right VIII ganglion was removed and asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md).

The hindbrain was photographed using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA). Once imaging was completed, asof051 was disposed of.



## Images asof051

Picture "asof051_001" - taken straight after the injection was done on 08/08/18. Shows labelled vestibulocochlear ganglia and fluorescent contamination around them. ![Image asof051_001](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof051_001.png)

Picture "asof051_002" - taken 08/08/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left vestibulocochlear ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. Both facial ganglia had also been removed. ![Image asof051_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof051_002.png)

Picture "asof051_003" - taken 09/08/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof051_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof051_003.png)

Picture "asof051_004" - taken 09/08/18. Shows the rhombomeres of the hindbrain using the UV filter. ![Image asof051_004](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof051_004.png)

Picture "asof051_005" - taken 09/08/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof051_004, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is also used to show the rhombomeres of the hindbrain. Vestibulocochlear motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and most VIII motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 4 and 5. ![Image asof051_005](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof051_005.png)

Picture "asof051_006" - taken 09/08/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof051_004, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is turned off so that only the DiI labelling can be seen. Vestibulocochlear motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and most VIII motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 4 and 5. ![Image asof051_006](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof051_006.png)

Picture "asof051_007" - taken 09/08/18. See description in asof051_004. This is a higher magnification view of that image, at the level of rhombomeres 4 and 5, which also shows the floor plate of the hindbrain. ![Image asof051_007](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof051_007.png)

Picture "asof051_008" - taken 09/08/18. See description in asof051_005. This is a higher magnification view of that image, and the same view as asof051_007. Some labelled cell bodies appear to be located either in or above the floor plate of the hindbrain. ![Image asof051_008](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof051_008.png)

Picture "asof051_009" - taken 09/08/18. See description in asof051_006. This is a higher magnification view of that image, and the same view as asof051_007. With reference to asof051_008, some labelled cell bodies appear to be located either in or above the floor plate of the hindbrain (although this is more easily seen in asof051_010). ![Image asof051_009](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof051_009.png)

Picture "asof051_010" - taken 09/08/18. See description in asof051_009. This is the same view as that image, but with higher exposure to show the numerous processes which cross the floor plate, and the cell bodies located in/above the floor plate. Note: a faint reflection of the labelling in the right VIIIth nerve makes it appear as though there is a small amount of DiI labelling of left VIIIth nerve motor neurons. However, there is no left VIIIth nerve labelling, as confirmed by observation of the specimen at different angles. ![Image asof051_010](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof051_010.png)

Picture "asof051_011" - taken 09/08/18. See description in asof051_007. This is a higher magnification view of that image, at the level of rhombomeres 4 and 5, which shows the floor plate of the hindbrain. This image is in complement to "asof051_multifocus001". ![Image asof051_011](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof051_011.png)

Picture "asof051_012" - taken 09/08/18. See description in asof051_008. This is a higher magnification view of that image, and the same view as asof051_011. This is taken at the level of rhombomeres 4 and 5, which shows the floor plate of the hindbrain. This image is in complement to "asof051_multifocus001". ![Image asof051_012](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof051_012.png)

Picture "asof051_multifocus001" - taken 09/08/18. This image is a z-stack of images, showing numerous labelled processes crossing the floor plate, and cell bodies located in/above the floor plate. ![Image asof051_multifocus001](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof051_multifocus001.png)

Picture "asof051_013" - taken 09/08/18. Shows three labelled cell bodies in the hindbrain alar plate (circled). The cell bodies are very difficult to see in this image, and can be much more clearly seen in asof051_023 - asof051_025. ![Image asof051_013_01](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof051_013_01.png)

Picture "asof051_014" - taken 09/08/18. Shows the same view as asof051_013, with the focus adjusted to show six additional labelled cell bodies in the hindbrain alar plate (circled). The cell bodies are very difficult to see in this image, and can be much more clearly seen in asof051_023 - asof051_025. ![Image asof051_014_01](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof051_014_01.png)

Pictures "asof051_015" - "asof051_022" - taken 09/08/18. These images show labelling which may represent either DiI contamination or biological variability. The labelling of interest is circled in each of the images. "asof051_020" also shows that there is no DiI labelling in the neurons of the left VIII nerve. The labelling circled in "asof051_022" is much further down in the hindbrain (more dorsal) than all other labelling in the hindbrain.
