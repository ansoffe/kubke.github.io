# Embryo asof026

The aim of this work was to generate a labelled embryo to use in testing the gelatin embedding technique.

Embryo "asof026". Stage 28 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 10/05/18, and ended on 16/05/18. Note: this is the eye mutant embryo. The dye only travelled throughout the ganglion, and in a haze into the hindbrain and tissue ventral to the hindbrain, so asof026 was disposed of. The haze was potentially due to the angle of the injection needle, and the dye may not have travelled properly because it is too old.


10/05/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, removed the amniotic sac and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof026 staging features:

- the outgrowth of the beak is evident in profile (27-28)
- protuberance f has a shape characteristic of stage 28
- protuberance c is large and rounded (28-29)
- four toes are present (28)
- three digits are present (>26)

Overall, asof026 was put as a stage 28 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was quite concentrated, as asof had scraped crusted crystals from the sides of the well back down into the well. There were a lot of these crusted crystals in the well and they produced a lot of concentrated dye. A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion. There was a little contamination around each of the trigeminal ganglia. The right (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof026 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated for 4 days at 40°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


15/05/18

In the morning, asof inspected asof026 and found that the DiI label had travelled throughout the trigeminal ganglion, and potentially into the hindbrain, although it was difficult to tell the latter because there was still a lot of uncleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. However, the labelling was definitely not the clear labelling of sensory and motor neurons that we are trying to get. Tissue ventral to the hindbrain (or in the hindbrain itself- it is difficult to tell) around the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had a hazy labeling which can be seen in asof026_003. Asof took a photograph of asof026 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3.


16/05/18

Since the DiI had not clearly labelled sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain, asof026 was disposed of.
