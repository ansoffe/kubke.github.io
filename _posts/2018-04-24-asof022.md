# Embryo asof022

The aim of this work was to generate data for my honours project.

Embryo "asof022". Stage 26 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 18/04/18, and ended on ????????????


18/04/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof022 staging features:

- between protuberances a, d, b and e, a zig-zag shaped crevice is present (26-27)
- maxillary process has definite bumps in it (>25)
- shape of digital and toe plates is similar to 26. They are smooth and rounded at the ends.

Overall, asof022 was put as a stage 26 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye used was highly concentrated due to mfk having put more DiI crystals in the well, and a high volume was injected into each ganglion. There was a little contamination around each of the trigeminal ganglia. The right (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control. Asof took photographs of asof022 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated for 2 days at 40°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.

When inspected in the afternoon, the DiI label in asof022 appeared to have travelled from the ganglion into the sensory neurons of the hindbrain. Not as much DiI had travelled as in asof020 and asof021. It was difficult to tell whether the motor neurons had been labelled, since the dye was quite faint, and a lot of tissue was still present overlying the hindbrain. Asof cleared some of the tissue overlying the hindbrain before taking a picture of asof022, using the microscope and filter mentioned above. The embryo was then placed into a new batch of ice cold ![HM solution (STIFF GEL)](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hm-solution-(stiff-gel)-recipe.md) and kept at 4°C for 10 days with gentle shaking.


01/05/18

Asof de-gassed the tube according to the ![Hydrogel tissue embedding protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hydrogel-tissue-embedding-protocol.md) and put asof022 into the incubator at 40°C. 


03/05/18

The HM gel had polymerised when the tube was checked in the morning. This was tested by inverting the tube, and seeing that the gel did not move. The polymerised HM gel containing asof022 was removed from the eppendorf tube. Asof put the embryo in a 30% sucrose solution, and this was kept for 24 hours at 4°C. Note: the gel did not seem to have polymerised as well as usual, with the gel having less of a stiff consistency than previously. This was possibly due to the 3°C increase in temperature.


04/05/18

Asof cut asof022 with the sledge microtome (which has a freezing attachment) as follows. The HM gel containing the embryo was placed onto a drop of OCT on the microtome block and frozen at -29°C. The microtome was used to cut cross-sectional slices, with Tray 1 Rows A-C being 50um, and Tray 1 Row D and Trays 2-4 containing 35um sections. Trigeminal ganglion fluorescence was present in Tray 2 Row B - Tray 3 Row C.

Sections from  Tray 2, Row B-D were placed into de-ionised water (containing a drop of Triton X100), then mounted onto glass slides. These were allowed to air dry for 4 days. Note: the hydrogel monomer gel did not hold together very well when mounted.


08/05/18

The slides were coverslipped with 95% glycerol and visualised using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA).



## Images asof022

Picture "asof022_001" - taken straight after the injection was done on 18/04/18. Shows both trigeminal ganglia, and dye contamination around them.

Picture "asof022_002" - taken on 18/04/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the right trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. ![Image asof022_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof022_002.png)

Picture "asof022_003" - taken on 20/04/18 after two days of incubation. Shows that some dye has travelled into sensory neurons (this is very faint in the image), and potentially some motor neurons are labelled as well, although it is difficult to tell. ![Image asof022_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof022_003.png)
