# Photo-oxidation 003

The aim of this work was to see if the results of the photo-oxidation method could be improved by following the protocol more stringently (in past photo-oxidation experiments, for one reason or another, the protocol had not been followed very exactly). One floating section of ![asof011](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-01-22-asof011.md) was used in this experiment. These sections contained DiI label in the trigeminal and auditory ganglia. This experiment began and was completed on 12/04/18.


12/04/18

Asof checked the floating section of asof011 for the presence of fluorescence before the start of the experiment, using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA). There was some fluorescence in the slice. The section was then placed into 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7) for three washes, lasting 15 minutes, 40 minutes, and 20 minutes respectively.

Mfk made the 2mg/ml DAB solution (100mg of DAB in 50ml of 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7)) and placed this on ice, wrapped in tin foil.

The asof011 section was transferred to 2mg/ml DAB solution and allowed to preincubate, on ice, in the dark, for 20 minutes.

The section was then transferred into fresh DAB and placed under the dissecting fluorescence microscope using the filter ET-CY3 (red filter), on ice. The DAB solution was replaced every 15-20 minutes for 5 hours. Each time the DAB solution was replaced, the ice was also replaced. Four photographs were taken throughout the photo-oxidation period, as detailed below.

After five hours of photo-oxidation, the section was transferred into 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7) for three washes, lasting 15 minutes each. The section was stored at room temperature in 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7).


## Photo-oxidation 003 images:

Image photoox003_001 - taken at the beginning of photo-oxidation, when the section was placed under the fluorescence microscope, to show the intensity of the original fluoresence as a reference. ![Image photoox003_001](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/photoox003_001.png)

Image photoox003_002 - taken after two hours of photo-oxidation. Shows that fluorescence is still present. Some DAB product substrate is present, but could not be captured with the camera. ![Image photoox003_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/photoox003_002.png)

Image photoox003_003 - taken after 4.5 hours of photo-oxidation. Shows that the fluorescence has faded slightly, but not much.

Image photoox003_004 - taken after 5 hours of photo-oxidation. Shows that fluorescence in the section is dimmer but still present.
