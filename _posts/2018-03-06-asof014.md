# Embryo asof014

The aim of this work was for asof to practice injecting the dye into the ganglia, as she had not yet managed to be successful in getting the dye to travel from the ganglia into the neuron processes in the hindbrain.

Embryo "asof014". Stage: early 24 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 01/03/18, and was completed on 02/03/18. Asof tried using more concentrated DiI in the injection, and injecting a greater volume of dye, into the ganglia, on mfk's recommendation. This injection was successful, in that the dye travelled down the neuron processes into the hindbrain.

01/03/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac from the embryo. Asof then staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof014 staging features:

- the bulge of the maxillary process was rounded (24)
- the mandibular process and pharyngeal arch II overall appearance (23)
- toe and digital plates rounded (24)

Overall, the embryo was put at an early stage 24 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected and peeled out the otic vesicles to expose the following ganglia:
- V (both sides)
- VII (both sides)
- VIII (both sides)

These ganglia may have been incorrectly identified, as mfk did not check them. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia and both auditory ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The volume of dye injected was greater than asof had used in past injections. There was a lot of contamination around each of the ganglia injected, confirmed using the fluorescence microscope. The embryo was incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.

Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI was mixed somewhat with another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.

02/03/18

In the morning, asof could see using the fluorescence microscope that the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the cranial nerve neuron processes in the hindbrain. Asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain, and removed the ganglia. Asof then put the embryo through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md).

Asof used a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain in the hindbrain. All nerves had taken up the stain, although in the right trigeminal (embryo p.o.v.) nerve, the dye had not travelled as far as compared to the nerves of the other ganglia.

Asof took 6 pictures, as detailed below.

## Images asof014:

Picture "asof014_001" - shows a low magnification view of the whole hindbrain, with the trigeminal (top) and auditory (lower) neurons labelled on both sides. Both sensory (vertical processes on the edge of the hindbrain) and motor (processes projecting horizontally in a fan shape) are labelled. ![Image asof014_001](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof014_001_01.png)

Picture "asof014_002" - shows a higher magnification view of the whole hindbrain, with the trigeminal (top) and auditory (lower) neurons labelled on both sides. Both sensory (vertical processes on the edge of the hindbrain) and motor (processes projecting horizontally in a fan shape) are labelled. ![Image asof014_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof014_002_01.png)

Picture "asof014_003" - shows a high magnification view of the auditory nerve neurons (left side, embryo p.o.v.). Small chain-link-like shapes in the labelled processes can be seen, which are motor neurons in the basal plate. ![Image asof014_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof014_003_01.png)

Picture "asof014_004" - shows a high magnification view of the trigeminal nerve neurons (left side, embryo p.o.v.). Small chain-link-like shapes in the labelled processes can be seen, which are motor neurons in the basal plate. ![Image asof014_004](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof014_004_01.png)

Picture "asof014_005" - shows a high magnification view of the auditory nerve neurons (right side, embryo p.o.v.). Small chain-link-like shapes in the labelled processes can be seen, which are motor neurons in the basal plate. ![Image asof014_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof014_005_01.png)

Picture "asof014_006" - may show migrating auditory neurons on the right side of the auditory nerve entrance to the hindbrain (embryo p.o.v.). ![Image asof014_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof014_006_01.png)
