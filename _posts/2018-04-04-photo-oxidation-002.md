# Photo-oxidation 002

The aim of this work was to test the photo-oxidation method. Dry mounted sections of ![asof011](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-01-22-asof011.md) were used in this experiment. One floating section of ![asof011](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-01-22-asof011.md) was used in this experiment. These sections contained DiI label in the trigeminal and auditory ganglia. This experiment began and was completed on 04/04/18.

## Mounted sections

Asof checked the mounted sections of asof011 for the presence of fluorescence before the start of the experiment, using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA). There was some fluorescence in each slice. Asof equilibrated one 35um slice of asof011 in 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7) at room temperature, for 15 minutes twice, and then for 5hrs15mins once. This was done using a glass coplin jar.

Mfk made the 2mg/ml DAB solution (20mg of DAB in 10ml of 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7)) and placed this on ice, wrapped in tin foil.

The mounted sections were preincubated in DAB solution on ice in the dark for 20 mins.

The mounted sections were placed for 15 minutes under the non-dissecting fluorescence microscope using the red filter (filter #3), not on ice. Only one section on the slide was directly under the beam of light. After 15 minutes, the DAB solution was replaced with a fresh DAB solution. After another 15 minutes, the section was checked for the presence of a brown substrate. It was unclear whether any such substrate had formed. Since we had run out of DAB solution, the DAB solution was not changed. The section was left under the microscope for another 2.5 hours.

The sections were then washed in 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7) - once for 20 minutes and then left in a fresh 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7) solution overnight. These sections were then allowed to air-dry.


## Floating section

The same 2mg/ml DAB solution mentioned above was used in this experiment, as it was carried out simultaneously with the mounted sections experiment.

One floating section was placed in 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7) for one wash, lasting 15 minutes. This section was transferred to 2mg/ml DAB solution and allowed to preincubate, on ice, in the dark, for 15 minutes.

This section was then transferred into a fresh 2mg/ml DAB solution and placed under the dissecting fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) on ice. The section was checked after 25 minutes for the presence of brown DAB substrate, but none was apparent. Since we had run out of DAB solution, the DAB solution was not changed. The section was left under the microscope for another 2.5 hours on ice. No DAB substrate was apparent after this time.

The floating section was removed from the DAB solution and washed three times in 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7), for 15 minutes per wash. The slice was stored at room temperature in 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7).
