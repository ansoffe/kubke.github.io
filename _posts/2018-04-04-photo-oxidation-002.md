# Photo-oxidation 002

The aim of this work was to test the photo-oxidation method. Dry mounted slices of ![asof011](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-01-22-asof011.md) were used in this experiment. These slices contained DiI label in the trigeminal and auditory ganglia. This experiment began and was completed on 04/04/18.
