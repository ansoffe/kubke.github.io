# Photo-oxidation 002

The aim of this work was to test the photo-oxidation method. Dry mounted slices of ![asof011](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-01-22-asof011.md) were used in this experiment. These slices contained DiI label in the trigeminal and auditory ganglia. This experiment began and was completed on 04/04/18.


04/04/18

Asof checked the mounted slices of asof011 for the presence of fluorescence before the start of the experiment, using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA). There was some fluorescence in each slice. Asof equilibrated one 35um slice of asof011 in 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer at room temperature, for 15 minutes twice, and then for ????? once. This was done using a glass coplin jar.
