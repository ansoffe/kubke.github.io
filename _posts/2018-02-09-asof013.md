# Embryo asof013

The aim of this work was to test a longer embedding period to determine if this will give better penetration of the gel into the tissue of the embryo.

Embryo "asof012". Stage 25+ (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 01/02/18, and was completed on ?????????/01/18.

01/02/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac from the embryo. Asof then staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof012 staging features:

- The point of protuberance "e" can be seen between protuberances "c" and "f" of the pharyngeal arches (~25)
- Overall appearance of the maxillary process and the place where the future bill will be (~26)
- At least 2 toes are demarcated in the toe plate (early 26)
- No digits are exident in the digital plate (early 26)

Overall, the embryo was put at a stage 25+ (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected and peeled out the otic vesicles to expose the following ganglia:
- V (both sides)
- VII (both sides)
- VIII (right, embryo p.o.v.)

These ganglia may have been incorrectly identified, as mfk did not check them. There were only remnants of the vesitubulocochlear ganglion, because it was damaged by asof's dissection. Asof also dissected off too much tissue ventral to the surface of the hinbrain, so there was a higher possibility of contamination during the labelling process.

Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The embryo was incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.

02/02/18

Asof checked the embryo under the fluorescence microscope, and found that contamination was present in  many places all over the embryo. However, since the primary purpose of asof013 was to test the HM solution penetration with a longer embedding period, asof013 was placed into ice cold ![HM solution (STIFF GEL)](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hm-solution-(stiff-gel)-recipe.md) and kept at 4°C for 10 days with gentle shaking.

12/02/18

Asof de-gassed the tube according to the ![Hydrogel tissue embedding protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hydrogel-tissue-embedding-protocol.md) and put asof013 into the incubator at 37°C. 

13/02/18

After roughly 24 hours of incubation, the HM gel had polymerised. This was tested by inverting the tube, and seeing that the gel did not move. Asof removed the gel from the tube and placed it into a 30% sucrose solution, which was kept for 24 hours at 4°C.

14/02/18

Asof cut asof013 with the sledge microtome (which has a freezing attachment) as follows. The HM gel containing the embryo was removed from the sucrose solution and placed onto a drop of OCT on the microtome block and frozen at -29°C. The microtome was used to cut cross-sectional slices, at 50um, and at 35um. These slices were placed into trays with wells containing PBS. Asof mounted the slices from trays 4 (50um), 5 (35um) and 6 (50um) in deionized water (containing a drop of Triton X100) onto glass slides. These were allowed to air dry for 24 hours.

15/02/18

Asof mounted the slices in trays 1 (50um), 2 (50um) and 3 (35um) in deionized water (containing a drop of Triton X100) onto glass slides. These were allowed to air dry for 24 hours.
