# Embryo asof063


The aim of this work was to generate an embryo with labelled Vth cranial nerve neurons for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof063". Stage 22 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 06/09/18, and ended on 07/09/18. Labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was not achieved so asof063 was disposed of.
