# Embryo asof063


The aim of this work was to generate an embryo with labelled Vth cranial nerve neurons for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof063". Stage 22 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 06/09/18, and ended on 07/09/18. Labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was not achieved so asof063 was disposed of.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected quite carefully so as not to damage or remove the nerve fibres
- As much dye as possible without majorly damaging the ganglion was injected into each ganglion
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated
- Both ganglia were injected from their medial aspect
- The right V ganglion was injected twice
- Both injections into the right ganglion contained only pink dye
- The motor root could be seen, labelled, on the right Vg
- Left V ganglion was damaged (half of ventral branch accidentally removed)


06/09/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof063 staging features:
- wing buds are caudally pointing, and shorter than they are wide (22) and shaped like stage 22
- leg buds are caudally pointing, and slight shorter than wide (22+)
- somites not quite extending to the tip of the tail? (21)
- dorsal contour is fairly straight (see lab notebook for sketch)

Overall, asof063 was put at a stage 22 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI by pressure injection with methanol. The left ganglion was removed as a control, and then the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof063 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


07/09/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had not travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then asof063 was disposed of.
