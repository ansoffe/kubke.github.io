# Embryo asof017

The aim of this work was to try to get the DiI labelling method to work.

Embryo "asof017". Stage 28 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 09/04/18, and ended on ????????????


09/04/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. Asof staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof017 staging features:

- bill is evident (28)
- protuberance c is rounded, appearance of c is characteristic of stage 28
- the shape of protuberance f is characteristic of stage 28
- one toe is longer than the others, 3 toes are evident and another toe may be present (27-28)
- one digit is longer than the others, 2 digits are evident and also the beginnings of a third digit

Overall, asof017 was put as a stage 28 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo, and the facial ganglion on the right side (embryo p.o.v.). Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye used was much more concentrated than that used in past injections, as Mfk had put more DiI crystals into the well (there had been no crystals in the well in past injections). There was some contamination around each of the trigeminal ganglia, confirmed using the fluorescence microscope, and shown in image asof017_001 at the end of this entry. The embryo was incubated for 2 days at 40°C in PBS (a higher temperature was used to see if this would help the DiI to travel better). Note: the PBS surrounding the embryo dried up twice over the course of the two day incubation before being replaced.

Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.

11/04/18

When inspected in the morning, the label in asof017 did not appear to have travelled any further than the trigeminal ganglion. Asof took photographs of asof016 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3 unless specified otherwise.


## Images asof017

Picture "asof017_001" - taken straight after the injection was done on 09/04/18. Shows both trigeminal ganglia, and dye contamination.

Picture "asof017_002" - taken on 09/04/18 after contamination had been removed and the right trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had been removed.

Picture "asof017_003" - taken on 11/04/18 after two days incubation. Shows that the DiI label has not travelled past the trigeminal ganglion.

Picture "asof017_004" - taken on 11/04/18. Close-up view of asof017_003, showing that fluorescence is present throughout the trigeminal ganglion.

Picture "asof017_005" - taken on 11/04/18. Same view as asof017_004, using UV filter to show that there is not much dye in the trigeminal ganglion.

The embryo was then covered with 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer to equilibrate.
