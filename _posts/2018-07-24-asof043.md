# Embryo asof043

The aim of this work was to test whether labelled neurons could be better imaged in hindbrain sections if the sectioning was carried out on the day after DiI injection, and also without having subjected the embryo to glycerol.

Embryo "asof043". Stage 23+ (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 23/07/18, and ended on 25/07/18. Good labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was achieved. This embryo was embedded in gelatin and sectioned. However, the DiI labelling in the hindbrain was still fuzzy and unspecific, so it was decided that asof would focus on a wholemount imaging project for the foreseeable future.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected moderately carefully so as not to damage or remove the motor root of the trigeminal nerve (but less carefully than asof037 and asof038)
- A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion
- The ganglia were primarily injected from the medial aspect
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated
- Injection into this embryo had purple crystals


23/07/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof043 staging features:
- overall shape of the pharyngeal arches resembles a stage 23+ (protuberance c is pointed, similar to a stage 24, but not receeded far enough to be a stage 24)
- wing and leg buds are roughly as long as they are wide, and pointing caudally (23)

Overall, asof043 was put at a stage 23+ (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal and facial ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Cleared the tissue around each trigeminal ganglion quite well, all around and on the medial side of the most ventral part of the ganglion. But, did not do much clearing close to the medial base of the ganglia, to avoid accidentally removing the motor root. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected into each trigeminal ganglion, using a technique where the needle was inserted into the ganglion and then retracted slightly before expelling dye, which meant less force was required to expel dye. A motor root could be seen labelled on both ganglia during the injection. Injections into the right Vg were done three times from the medial aspect. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof043 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


24/07/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the embryo was then placed into paraformaldehyde (4% PFA in PB 0.1M solution) for 1 hour. The embryo was then transferred into a 7.5% gelatine solution, prepared according to the ![gelatin recipe](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/gelatin-recipe.md). This was left to embed for 4 hours. 

Next, the tube containing asof043 was placed into the fridge at 4°C to solidify. This was rotated by hand until the gelatin began to solidify, but it was difficult to get the embryo into the middle of the gelatin. This was left on a rocker in the fridge for 2.5 hours, after which the gelatin containing asof043 was removed from the tube and placed into cold paraformaldehyde (4% PFA in PB 0.1M solution). This was left in the fridge at 4°C for 1 hour. The gelatin seemed fairly well solidified.

The gelatin was rinsed in 0.01M PBS, and frozen at -29°C on the sliding microtome in a blob of Oct.  Cross-sectional slices were cut at 50um. Sections were placed into PBS in 24 well trays on ice, and then placed into the fridge. Trigeminal ganglion fluorescence was present from roughly Tray 1 Row A4 - Tray 1 Row C. 

Mfk and asof imaged the floating sections with a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) using filter ET-CY3. Mfk thought that the labelling looked a lot sharper (not fuzzy) and so recommended that these sections be mounted for imaging. The sections were left floating in PBS overnight, at 4 degrees.


25/07/18

Sections from Tray 1 RowA5 - Tray 1 Row D3 were mounted in cold de-ionised water (containing a drop of Triton X100) onto glass slides. The sections were allowed to dry somewhat, and then coverslipped with 100% glycerol. These were imaged with a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) using filter ET-CY3, after around an hour in glycerol. However, mfk and asof observed that the labelling in the hindbrain was very fuzzy and non-specific. This effect seemed to be quite isolated to the hindbrain, as labelling in the ganglion sections was clear and defined. Therefore, the remainder of the sections which had not been mounted were disposed of.

Picture "asof043_002" - taken 23/07/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. ![Image asof043_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof043_002.png)

Picture "asof043_003" - taken 24/07/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof043_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof043_003.png)

Picture "asof043_tray1_B2_003" - taken 25/07/18. This is an example, showing the unspecific, fuzzy DiI labelling in the hindbrain sections. ![Image asof043_tray1_B2_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof043_tray1_B2_003.png)
