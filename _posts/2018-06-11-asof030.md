# Embryo asof030

The aim of this work was to determine whether cryoprotecting in sucrose had an effect on unspecific DiI labelling. 

Embryo "asof030". Stage 23+ (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 11/06/18, and ended on ???. Motor and sensory neurons were well labelled in this embryo. This embryo was used for comparison with asof027 - both were embedded in gelatin but asof030 was not cryoprotected with sucrose.


11/06/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof030 staging features:
- pharyngeal arches overall shape resembles a stage 24
- wing and leg buds are as long as they are wide (23)

Overall, asof030 was put at a stage 23+ (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI straight before the injection. Dye was injected until the trigeminal ganglia were too perforated to allow further injections (although this happened after fewer injections than in past embryos). The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof028 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated for 2 days at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


12/06/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. A photograph was taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) and then the embryo was left to incubate for a further 24 hours at 37°C.


13/06/18

In the morning, another picture was taken of asof031, showing that there was much denser labelling than there had been 24 hours previously. The embryo was then placed in paraformaldehyde (4% PFA in PB 0.1M solution) for 4 hours.

The embryo was removed from the paraformaldehyde solution, and placed into a 7.5% gelatin solution (1.1268g gelatin in 15ml of 0.01M PBS, dissolved at 40°C). This was incubated at 37°C overnight.


## Images asof030

Picture "asof030_001" - taken straight after the injection was done on 11/06/18. Shows both trigeminal ganglia, and dye contamination around them. ![Image asof030_001](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof030_001.png)

Picture "asof030_002" - taken on 11/06/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. ![Image asof030_002](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof030_002.png)

Picture "asof030_003" - taken on 12/06/18 after asof030 had been incubated overnight. Shows DiI labelling in both motor and sensory neurons of the hindbrain. ![Image asof030_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof030_003.png)

Picture "asof030_004" - taken on 13/06/18 after asof030 had been incubated for 1.5 days. Shows denser DiI labelling of motor neurons in the hindbrain. Same image exposure as images 001-003. ![Image asof030_004](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof030_004.png)

Picture "asof030_005" - taken on 13/06/18.  after asof030 had been incubated for 1.5 days. Shows that DiI labelling has not travelled into the hindbrain. Lower image exposure than image 004, so that individual motor neuron processes can be seen. ![Image asof030_005](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof030_005.png)
