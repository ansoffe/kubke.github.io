# Embryo asof048

The aim of this work was to generate a labelled embryo for use in imaging motor neurons in a wholemount.

Embryo "asof048". Stage 23 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 02/07/18, and ended on 03/08/18. Good labelling of hindbrain sensory and motor neurons was achieved. This embryo was put through a series of glycerol and motor neurons were imaged in the wholemount.

Specifics of injection:
- Tried to replicate the injection procedure of asof037 and asof038
- During injection, the needle was pushed into ganglion, and then retracted slightly before ejecting dye (this meant dye could be injected without requiring a great amount of force)
- This embryo was dissected quite carefully so as not to damage or remove the motor root of the trigeminal nerve (less carefully than asof037 and asof038, but more carefully than asof045 and asof046)
- A high volume of dye was injected into each ganglion
- The ganglia were primarily injected from the medial aspect
- Large crystals of DiI are still present in the well, so the dye was highly concentrated


02/08/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution and covered the embryo with 0.01M PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac and staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof048 staging features:
- the overall shape of the pharyngeal arches is very characteristic of a stage 23
- leg and wing buds are slightly longer than they are wide, but not yet long enough to be a stage 24 (23+)

Overall, asof048 was put at a stage 23 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the trigeminal ganglia on both sides of the embryo. Cleared the tissue around each trigeminal ganglion quite well, all around and on the medial side of the most ventral part of the ganglion. But, did not do much clearing close to the medial base of the ganglia, to avoid accidentally removing the motor root. Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with concentrated red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The dye was very concentrated, as asof had added large crystals to the well from the bottle of DiI on 11/06/18. A high volume of dye was injected into each trigeminal ganglion, using a technique where the needle was inserted into the ganglion and then retracted slightly before expelling dye, which meant less force was required to expel dye. The left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion was then removed as a control, and the contamination was cleared. Asof took photographs of asof048 using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain, using filter ET-CY3. The embryo was then incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI may have been mixed with a very small amount of another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.



03/08/18

When inspected in the morning, the dye had travelled from the ganglion into the sensory and motor neurons of the hindbrain. Photographs were taken with the fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), and then the right V ganglion was removed and asof cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain. The hindbrain was separated from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md).

Once imaging was completed, asof048 was disposed of.

Picture "asof048_003" - taken 02/08/18 after the contamination had been removed, and the left trigeminal ganglion (embryo p.o.v.) had also been removed. Fluorescence intensity = 2nd notch. ![Image asof048_003](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof048_003.png)

Picture "asof048_005" - taken 03/08/18. Shows DiI labelling of sensory and motor neurons in the hindbrain after overnight incubation. It is difficult to see the motor neurons due to tissue overlying the ventral aspect of the hindbrain. ![Image asof048_005](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof048_005.png)

Picture "asof048_006" - taken 03/08/18. Shows the rhombomeres of the hindbrain using the UV filter. ![Image asof048_006](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof048_006.png)

Picture "asof048_007" - taken 03/08/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof048_006, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is also used to show the rhombomeres of the hindbrain. Trigeminal motor and sensory neurons are labelled, and all V motor neuron labelling appears to be confined within rhombomeres 2 and 3, except for one motor neuron in rhombomere 4 (cannot be seen in this image, see asof048_016). ![Image asof048_007](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof048_007.png)

Picture "asof048_008" - taken 03/08/18. Shows the same view of the hindbrain as in asof048_006, using the ET-CY3 filter to visualise the DiI labelling. The white light is turned off so that only the DiI labelling can be seen. Trigeminal motor and sensory neurons are labelled. ![Image asof048_008](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof048_008.png)

Picture "asof048_009" - taken 03/08/18. See description in asof048_008. This is the same view but with black paper underneath the dish to try to get rid of the fluorescent reflection. ![Image asof048_009](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof048_009.png)

Picture "asof048_010" - taken 03/08/18. See description in asof048_006. This is a higher magnification view of that image. ![Image asof048_010](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof048_010.png)

Picture "asof048_011" - taken 03/08/18. See description in asof048_007. This is a higher magnification view of that image, and the same view as asof048_010. Some neuron cell bodies appear to be located either in or above the floor plate. This image also shows that all motor neuron labelling is confined to rhombomeres 2 and 3. ![Image asof048_011](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof048_011.png)

Picture "asof048_013" - taken 03/08/18. Shows the proximal ends of three labelled processes that project across the midline. ![Image asof048_013](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof048_013.png)

Picture "asof048_014" - taken 03/08/18. Shows the distal ends of three labelled processes that project across the midline. Two of the processes have a labelled cell body at their distal end. This is a different view to asof048_013, and has higher gain than that image. This image also shows that there is no contralateral trigeminal motor neuron labelling. ![Image asof048_014](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof048_014.png)

Picture "asof048_015" - taken 03/08/18. Shows rhombomeres 3, 4 and 5 of the hindbrain. ![Image asof048_015](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_data/asof048_015.png)
